The types of surgical interventions are listed on Table 1 and were all performed by the same surgeon. All patients had soft-tissue releases (i.e. muscular lengthenings; Table 1 ). Adductors releases are usually performed systematically when surgery involves femoral derotation or varus osteotomies. Peroneals lengthenings are carried out whenever internal tibial derotation is necessary. Distal rectus femoris tenotomy, hamstrings lengthenings and gastrocsoleus release were the most common soft-tissue releases performed during multilevel surgery procedures.
