The study was limited by its small size, relatively short follow-up period, enrollment of only adolescents, lack of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, antihypertensive medication administration that was nonstandardized, recording changes in dry weight once a month only, and crossover design that had the potential for unequal carryover effects across study periods.", "section": "Discussion", "classification_label": 1, "section_number": 24, "sentences": ["To our knowledge, this is the first randomized pediatric trial designed to test the benefits of more frequent HD treatment sessions.", "Strengths of our study include the multicenter enrollment and data collection that was mostly standard of care and that can inform the design of future, more pragmatic, clinical trials.", "The study was limited by its small size, relatively short follow-up period, enrollment of only adolescents, lack of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, antihypertensive medication administration that was nonstandardized, recording changes in dry weight once a month only, and crossover design that had the potential for unequal carryover effects across study periods."], "doc_id": "35580"}
