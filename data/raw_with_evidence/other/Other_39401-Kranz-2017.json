Crossover exposure to 3 experimental and 1 control breakfast conditions showed an overall consistent change in energy and nutrient intakes for all 3 intervention breakfasts. Our results differ from other published results, in that the children in this study compensated for the reduced energy intake at breakfast during lunch. This study offers a further step toward a better understanding of preschool child nutrition. The role of satiation and satiety may be a critical aspect of obesity prevention and treatment in early childhood.", "section": "Discussion", "classification_label": 1, "section_number": 38, "sentences": ["In conclusion, we showed that the preschoolers in this study were able to communicate their feelings of fullness by using a newly developed pictorial assessment tool.", "Crossover exposure to 3 experimental and 1 control breakfast conditions showed an overall consistent change in energy and nutrient intakes for all 3 intervention breakfasts.", "Our results differ from other published results, in that the children in this study compensated for the reduced energy intake at breakfast during lunch.", "This study offers a further step toward a better understanding of preschool child nutrition.", "The role of satiation and satiety may be a critical aspect of obesity prevention and treatment in early childhood."], "doc_id": "39401"}
