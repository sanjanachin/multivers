Fourth, this was a singlecenter study. To exclude center-based bias, a multicenter study is required. Fifth, there was a significant difference between the two groups in cumulative tolerated dose before intervention, even though randomization had been performed. Although significant difference was observed after excluding patients with cumulative tolerated dose <200 mg, we could not evaluate the effectiveness of OIT in severe egg allergy patients.", "section": "Discussion", "classification_label": 1, "section_number": 23, "sentences": ["Second, we had an elimination group but not a placebo group as a control.", "Psychological changes might have affected the present results.", "Third, we observed the efficacy of OIT only for a short period of 6 months.", "While previous studies have shown that desensitization was induced after OIT therapy, its long-term effect remains unknown.
