Children with ADHD who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to a block that comprised a permutation of four participants, two for each group separately. The grouping scheme was concealed in envelopes, and the recruited participant was notified of his or her group sequentially. During the study, the intervention group received a 12-session training program for multiple executive skills once a week, whereas the waitlist group did not receive any new intervention. After the postintervention data collection, participants in the waitlist group had the opportunity to receive the same intervention to adhere to ethical considerations.", "section": "Study design and procedure", "classification_label": 0, "section_number": 6, "sentences": ["The study adopted a randomized block design to balance the individuals between the intervention and waitlist groups.", "Children with ADHD who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to a block that comprised a permutation of four participants, two for each group separately.", "The grouping scheme was concealed in envelopes, and the recruited participant was notified of his or her group sequentially.", "During the study, the intervention group received a 12-session training program for multiple executive skills once a week, whereas the waitlist group did not receive any new intervention.", "After the postintervention data collection, participants in the waitlist group had the opportunity to receive the same intervention to adhere to ethical considerations."], "doc_id": "39164"}
