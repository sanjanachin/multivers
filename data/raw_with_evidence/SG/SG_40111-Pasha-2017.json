    "text": "Informed consent was obtained from the mothers; then, the infants were divided into two groups of intervention and control. The target sample size for each group was 20 infants based on previous studies and mean difference formula with the aim of reaching a confidence level of 95%, accuracy of 0.5%, and power of 85%. The newborns were put in a quiet environment (nursery) before, during, and after the intervention. At first, temperature of the newborns was measured using axillary method and if their temperature was normal (range: 36.5-37.5\u00b0C) (20) , the newborns were exposed to a radiant heater (HKN-93B model, China). A temperature control probe was attached on the right side of the abdomen of the neonates with an adhesive tape with the length of 2 cm.",
