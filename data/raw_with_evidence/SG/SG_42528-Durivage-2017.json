Randomization proceeded by obtaining a sequence of group assignments for participants randomly permuted in blocks of varying sizes (sizes of 2, 4, 6, or 8), where the size and order of the blocks were also random. Such a randomization procedure is useful as it maintains blinding by concealing the pattern and size of the blocks. Sealed envelopes were used for allocation concealment.
