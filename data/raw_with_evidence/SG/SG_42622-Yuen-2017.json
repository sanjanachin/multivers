The department could unmask individual allocations from the secured sequence for a suspected serious adverse event. Hospital pharmacists prepared the study drugs in numbered indistinguishable containers, the contents of which patients and investigators were blinded to. Aloe vera syrup was used as placebo and chloral hydrate was either 200 mg.ml \u00c01 (Hong Kong) or 100 mg.ml \u00c01 (China). The atomised nasal spray was saline or dexmedetomidine 100 lg.ml \u00c01 (MAD \u00e2 ; Teleflex Medical China, Shanghai, China). Thirty minutes before the CT study, children drank 1 ml.4 kg \u00c01 syrup (Hong Kong) or 2 ml.4 kg \u00c01 syrup (China) and received 0.03 ml.kg \u00c01 nasal spray. We recorded whether the child's reaction was unacceptable (crying or resisting) or acceptable (anxious but accepting, or calm and co-operative).
