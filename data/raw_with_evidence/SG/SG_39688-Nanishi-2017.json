{"sentence_labels": [-1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1], "text": "Patients were randomly assigned to either the IVIG group or the IVIG plus clarithromycin group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were allocated through dynamic randomization adjusted by the Kobayashi score 19 (<5 or \u22655) to ensure a balanced allocation of patients at high risk between the 2 groups. Dynamic randomization was performed using the minimization method, incorporating a random element, via a computer-generated interactive web-based response system. The Kobayashi score ranges from 0 to 11, with higher scores predicting the IVIG unresponsiveness in Japanese children. 19 The parameters of the Kobayashi score consists of age (1 point if \u226412 months), days of illness at diagnosis (2 points if \u22644 days), peripheral blood platelet counts (1 point if \u226430910 4 lL), neutrophil percentage (2 points if \u226580%), and serum concentration of sodium (2 points if \u2264133 mmol/L), asparate aminotransferase (2 points if \u2265100 IU/L), and C-reactive protein (1 point if \u2265100 mg/L).
