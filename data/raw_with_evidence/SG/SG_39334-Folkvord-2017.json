{"sentence_labels": [1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1], "text": "We used a randomized between-subjects design with two conditions (type of memory-game: fruit [see Fig. 1 ] vs. nonfood products [see Fig. 2] ). The two games were identical, except for the items on the backside. Children were told that they could eat freely from the bowls with fruit during the experiment; the dependent variable in this study was fruit intake. During playtime, children were presented four bowls of fruit, containing (1) mandarins, (2) apples, (3) bananas, and (4) grapes. The types of fruit that were selected for the memory-game and for the test food were based on popularity levels assessed in studies examining fruit intake among children in the Netherlands (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM), 2012; Voedingscentrum (Dutch Nutrition Centre), 2016). A pilot test was conducted (N = 6) to test whether children understood and liked the memory-game.", "section": "Experimental design and stimulus materials", "classification_label": 1, "section_number": 5, "sentences": ["We used a randomized between-subjects design with two conditions (type of memory-game: fruit [see Fig. 1 ] vs. nonfood products [see Fig. 2] ).", "The two games were identical, except for the items on the backside.", "Children were told that they could eat freely from the bowls with fruit during the experiment; the dependent variable in this study was fruit intake.", "During playtime, children were presented four bowls of fruit, containing (1) mandarins, (2) apples, (3) bananas, and (4) grapes.", "The types of fruit that were selected for the memory-game and for the test food were based on popularity levels assessed in studies examining fruit intake among children in the Netherlands (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM), 2012; Voedingscentrum (Dutch Nutrition Centre), 2016).", "A pilot test was conducted (N = 6) to test whether children understood and liked the memory-game."], "doc_id": "39334"}
