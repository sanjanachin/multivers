Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ration to receive probiotics or not (control group). While ten percent reduction in NEC frequency via probiotic supplementation is considered significant, and aiming for alpha value of 0.05 and beta value (power analysis) of 80%; the number of patients to be enrolled in both arms of the study was found to be 40. The infants with: detected chromosomal abnormalities, previous gastrointestinal system surgery, a diagnosis of metabolic disease, babies lost in the first postnatal week and babies with severe sepsis episode were excluded from the study.
