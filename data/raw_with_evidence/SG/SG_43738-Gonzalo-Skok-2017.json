Tests were performed on an indoor basketball court 1 week before training and 1 week after the training period. Tests included a 25-m running sprint test (with 5-and 15-m split times), a countermovement-jump (CMJ) test, a multiple-COD test (V-cut test), a 15-m-sprint test (7.5 m + 7.5 m) with one 180\u00b0 COD performed both right (180\u00b0-CODR) and left (180\u00b0-CODL) legs, and an incremental bilateral and unilateral squat-load test.
