Intervention group participants answered a set of questionnaires on the same day immediately after the injection, and control patients answered the same set of questionnaires on the same day, after the education was given. One month after the clinic visit, participants and their parents were mailed a follow-up questionnaire packet that was identical to that completed by the participant and parent on the day of recruitment.
