ECHOs were performed during the middle of the week, after a dialysis session, and were read centrally at CCHMC, with readers blinded to patient treatment assignment. We also obtained quality of life (QoL) assessments at baseline and after 12 weeks for each study period. QoL assessed for both parents and patients was measured with The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Scale and 3.0 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Scale and scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better QoL [22, 23] .
