Every six months, data were collected from each sibling, current foster parents/caregivers, teachers, and caseworkers, yielding a total of four major data-collection waves occurring at months 0, 6, 12, and 18. Assessors and coders were primarily undergraduate and post-BA students-some of whom were MSW students and grads-who completed training and participated in ongoing supervision by the project coordinator of the study. Assessors and coders were blinded as to treatment group participants. It is important to note that if a sibling changed placements during the study, the staff would orient, consent, and then collect data from the new caregiver(s); a similar procedure was followed when a participant was assigned a new caseworker or teacher.", "section": "Randomization and data collection.", "classification_label": 0, "section_number": 24, "sentences": ["Each youth was followed for 18 months.", "Every six months, data were collected from each sibling, current foster parents/caregivers, teachers, and caseworkers, yielding a total of four major data-collection waves occurring at months 0, 6, 12, and 18.", "Assessors and coders were primarily undergraduate and post-BA students-some of whom were MSW students and grads-who completed training and participated in ongoing supervision by the project coordinator of the study.", "Assessors and coders were blinded as to treatment group participants.", "It is important to note that if a sibling changed placements during the study, the staff would orient, consent, and then collect data from the new caregiver(s); a similar procedure was followed when a participant was assigned a new caseworker or teacher."], "doc_id": "35021"}
