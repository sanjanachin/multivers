At each session, participants were given the emotion vocabulary task. Then they were seated in front of a laptop positioned directly in front of them and adjusted for individual eye-level accordingly. The ER tasks were then presented in level order, from Levels 1 to 3, and run using a powerpoint slideshow. For each of the 16 questions at each level, a still shot of the scene was presented, and a scenario description relating to the scene was read out to the participant. The three silent animated clips of a character showing different emotional expressions were then played one after another and the child was asked to pick which clip of the three best matched the particular scenario (i.e., how would the character be feeling in reaction to the situation). In order to do this, the child had to point clearly to whichever clip they had chosen. Participants' answers were recorded manually by the experimenter.", "section": "Procedure", "classification_label": 1, "section_number": 28, "sentences": ["Time 1-3 assessments included one session each, lasting around 60 min.", "At each session, participants were given the emotion vocabulary task.", "Then they were seated in front of a laptop positioned directly in front of them and adjusted for individual eye-level accordingly.", "The ER tasks were then presented in level order, from Levels 1 to 3, and run using a powerpoint slideshow.", "For each of the 16 questions at each level, a still shot of the scene was presented, and a scenario description relating to the scene was read out to the participant.", "The three silent animated clips of a character showing different emotional expressions were then played one after another and the child was asked to pick which clip of the three best matched the particular scenario (i.e., how would the character be feeling in reaction to the situation).", "In order to do this, the child had to point clearly to whichever clip they had chosen.", "Participants' answers were recorded manually by the experimenter."], "doc_id": "39027"}
