Participants were instructed not to disclose their treatment status to the assessor. Blind raters were asked to guess allocation at the end of the interview. For cases where blind raters made a guess (n = 23), the agreement with actual allocation was no better than chance (Cohen's j = 09, p = .65); this suggests raters were indeed blind. Assessments at 6MFU and 12MFU were not blind as these were only administered to CT-PTSD participants.", "section": "Procedure", "classification_label": 0, "section_number": 13, "sentences": ["Posttreatment interview assessments were administered by postdoctoral-and postgraduate-level psychologists blind to condition; assessors did not deliver treatment or contribute to other elements of the trial and did not work in any of the settings where CT-PTSD was delivered.", "Participants were instructed not to disclose their treatment status to the assessor.", "Blind raters were asked to guess allocation at the end of the interview.", "For cases where blind raters made a guess (n = 23), the agreement with actual allocation was no better than chance (Cohen's j = 09, p = .65); this suggests raters were indeed blind.", "Assessments at 6MFU and 12MFU were not blind as these were only administered to CT-PTSD participants."], "doc_id": "33777"}
