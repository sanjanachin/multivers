{"sentence_labels": [-1, -1, 1, -1, -1], "text": "Children were assessed at least 12 wk after their most recent botulinum toxin therapy and were pair-matched for age and Manual Ability Classification System level (Eliasson et al., 2006) . Children were assessed at baseline (Time Point 1, or TP1), after 6 wk of intervention or control (TP2), at 6-wk follow-up (TP3), and at 6-mo follow-up (TP4; see Figure 1 ). All assessments were undertaken at each time point, including goal setting and subsequent scoring, by an assessor blinded to group allocation. With the assessor, who was trained to identify tasks involving obvious somatosensory cues, children and their parents set goals important to them that involved the upper limbs. After completing the baseline assessment, children were randomized to a group by a third party not involved with the study.", "section": "Participants", "classification_label": 0, "section_number": 6, "sentences": ["Children were assessed at least 12 wk after their most recent botulinum toxin therapy and were pair-matched for age and Manual Ability Classification System level (Eliasson et al., 2006) .", "Children were assessed at baseline (Time Point 1, or TP1), after 6 wk of intervention or control (TP2), at 6-wk follow-up (TP3), and at 6-mo follow-up (TP4; see Figure 1 ).", "All assessments were undertaken at each time point, including goal setting and subsequent scoring, by an assessor blinded to group allocation.", "With the assessor, who was trained to identify tasks involving obvious somatosensory cues, children and their parents set goals important to them that involved the upper limbs.", "After completing the baseline assessment, children were randomized to a group by a third party not involved with the study."], "doc_id": "40276"}
