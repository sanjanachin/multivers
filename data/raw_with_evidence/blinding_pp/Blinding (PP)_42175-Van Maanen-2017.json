Randomization took place using a preset list specifying whether a participant should receive medication (melatonin or placebo) or light on a 2:1 ratio. Children who were randomized to medication received either melatonin or placebo, dependent on a coding determined by the manufacturer, blind for the researcher and treatment provider (neurologist).
