Although we used evaluators who were blind to the conditions of the children, mothers might have rated their children more favorably when they knew that their children had received the intervention. More objective measures of the child outcomes need to be applied in future studies. Student teachers were assigned to two children each, but the student teachers were paired, and each pair visited all four of their individually assigned children to provide support and feedback to each other and ensure that the weekly program was implemented as planned. They continued this practice until they become comfortable working alone, but formal procedures for assessing fidelity are recommended for future studies. In addition, follow-up studies would confirm whether the intervention for these children has proven to be effective over the long term.", "section": "Limitations of the Study", "classification_label": 2, "section_number": 41, "sentences": ["Another limitation of the study is that the outcomes were based on mothers' reports on their children's development.", "Although we used evaluators who were blind to the conditions of the children, mothers might have rated their children more favorably when they knew that their children had received the intervention.", "More objective measures of the child outcomes need to be applied in future studies.", "Student teachers were assigned to two children each, but the student teachers were paired, and each pair visited all four of their individually assigned children to provide support and feedback to each other and ensure that the weekly program was implemented as planned.", "They continued this practice until they become comfortable working alone, but formal procedures for assessing fidelity are recommended for future studies.", "In addition, follow-up studies would confirm whether the intervention for these children has proven to be effective over the long term."], "doc_id": "40630"}
