To demonstrate statistical significance in the incidence of all grades of ROP to the tune that was observed in this study with an \u03b1-error of 0.05 and power of 80%, the estimated sample size should have been 502 (251 infants per group). Our study therefore remained underpowered. Additional limitation of our study was that infants <26 weeks were not included in the study, and therefore generalisability of the study is limited. The strength of our study is that it is a randomised controlled double blind trial. Caregivers were blinded to the nature of interventions.
