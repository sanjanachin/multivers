Parents of participants from the parental support groups were also given the parent guide, and were provided with a thorough guidance on its use. They were asked to support their child's learning, using the activities set in the guide. T2 testing took place 8 weeks later, and T3 testing took place 12 weeks after T2 (or as near to 12 weeks as was possible). The experimental procedures were identical to that described for T1, except for the administration of different versions of the three ER tasks at each level. Administration order of the different versions of the computerized tasks at Time 1-3 was counterbalanced within each generalization level. At the end of T3 testing, participants and their parents were debriefed with details about the purpose and future directions of the study and all the children received a free copy of TT DVD.", "section": "Procedure", "classification_label": 1, "section_number": 29, "sentences": ["At the end of T1 testing session, the parents were given a DVD copy of TT series or the control series and told that their child should watch a minimum of two episodes per day during the 8-week intervention period.", "Parents of participants from the parental support groups were also given the parent guide, and were provided with a thorough guidance on its use.", "They were asked to support their child's learning, using the activities set in the guide.", "T2 testing took place 8 weeks later, and T3 testing took place 12 weeks after T2 (or as near to 12 weeks as was possible).", "The experimental procedures were identical to that described for T1, except for the administration of different versions of the three ER tasks at each level.", "Administration order of the different versions of the computerized tasks at Time 1-3 was counterbalanced within each generalization level.", "At the end of T3 testing, participants and their parents were debriefed with details about the purpose and future directions of the study and all the children received a free copy of TT DVD."], "doc_id": "39027"}
