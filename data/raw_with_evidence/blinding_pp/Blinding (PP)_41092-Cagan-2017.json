Patients were divided into 4 age groups: 3-<12 months; 1-<3 years; 3-<7 years; and 7 years and older. Regardless of the clinical service, newly hospitalized patients were randomized to placebo or gelatin tannate. Every 2-3 weeks, patient numbers were calculated and recruitment adjustments made, if necessary, to try to equalize group numbers. As such, the study was conducted on a 'triple-blind' basis: physicians and nurses did not know whether the study drug administered was placebo or gelatin tannate; patients were not informed about whether they were being given placebo or gelatin tannate; and physicians and nurses did not know from which clinical service each patient had been referred.", "section": "Treatment and randomization", "classification_label": 0, "section_number": 9, "sentences": ["This single-center study involved a total of 5 pediatric clinical services.", "Patients were divided into 4 age groups: 3-<12 months; 1-<3 years; 3-<7 years; and 7 years and older.", "Regardless of the clinical service, newly hospitalized patients were randomized to placebo or gelatin tannate.", "Every 2-3 weeks, patient numbers were calculated and recruitment adjustments made, if necessary, to try to equalize group numbers.", "As such, the study was conducted on a 'triple-blind' basis: physicians and nurses did not know whether the study drug administered was placebo or gelatin tannate; patients were not informed about whether they were being given placebo or gelatin tannate; and physicians and nurses did not know from which clinical service each patient had been referred."], "doc_id": "41092"}
