{"sentence_labels": [-1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1], "text": "Introduction: Intranasal phenylephrine, an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, causes vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa and is used to reduce bleeding associated with nasotracheal intubation or endoscopic sinus surgery. The purpose of this study was to describe the hemodynamic effects associated with plasma phenylephrine concentrations following topical intranasal administration of 0.25% and 0.5% phenylephrine in children. Methods: After Institutional Review Board and parental approval, 77 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years were studied in a prospective, double-blind manner and randomized into three groups. Group 1 received intranasal saline, while groups 2 and 3 received 0.1 mL/kg of 0.25% or 0.5% phenylephrine, respectively. All received the same anesthetic of halothane, N 2 O, O 2 , and vecuronium. After inhalation induction, endtidal halothane and PaCO 2 were maintained at 1.", "section": "Abstract", "classification_label": 1, "sentences": ["Introduction: Intranasal phenylephrine, an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, causes vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa and is used to reduce bleeding associated with nasotracheal intubation or endoscopic sinus surgery.", "The purpose of this study was to describe the hemodynamic effects associated with plasma phenylephrine concentrations following topical intranasal administration of 0.25% and 0.5% phenylephrine in children.", "Methods: After Institutional Review Board and parental approval, 77 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years were studied in a prospective, double-blind manner and randomized into three groups.", "Group 1 received intranasal saline, while groups 2 and 3 received 0.1 mL/kg of 0.25% or 0.5% phenylephrine, respectively.", "All received the same anesthetic of halothane, N 2 O, O 2 , and vecuronium.", "After inhalation induction, endtidal halothane and PaCO 2 were maintained at 1."], "doc_id": "42095"}
