From the pool of those who agreed, 80 children met the criteria and were eligible for participation in the intervention program. After matching by gender and age, these children were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. After six months, 37 children out of 40 remained in the intervention group and 27 out of 40 in the control group.
