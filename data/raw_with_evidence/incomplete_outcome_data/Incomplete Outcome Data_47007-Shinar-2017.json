The trial was designed to detect a 10% increase in Hgb levels from allocation to 32 weeks of gestation. In order to obtain a power of 80% at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided), 64 patients needed to be enrolled in the trial in each arm. We aimed to recruit at least 110% to account for possible drop-outs during the course of the study. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 15 (SPSS Inc). Numerical data are shown as means \u00b1 standard deviations. Comparison between the two groups was performed using an unpaired Student's t-test for continuous variables and a chi-square test for non-continuous variables. Analysis with Yates' correction and Fisher's exact test were used where appropriate. A p value < .05 was considered statistically significant.", "section": "Statistical Analysis", "classification_label": 0, "section_number": 10, "sentences": ["Analysis was by intention to treat.", "The trial was designed to detect a 10% increase in Hgb levels from allocation to 32 weeks of gestation.", "In order to obtain a power of 80% at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided), 64 patients needed to be enrolled in the trial in each arm.", "We aimed to recruit at least 110% to account for possible drop-outs during the course of the study.", "All analyses were conducted using SPSS 15 (SPSS Inc).", "Numerical data are shown as means \u00b1 standard deviations.", "Comparison between the two groups was performed using an unpaired Student's t-test for continuous variables and a chi-square test for non-continuous variables.", "Analysis with Yates' correction and Fisher's exact test were used where appropriate.", "A p value < .05 was considered statistically significant."], "doc_id": "47007"}
