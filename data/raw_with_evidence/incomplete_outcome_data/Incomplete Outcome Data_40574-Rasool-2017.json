None of the women declined participation and were successfully randomised into either of the two equal groups group A and B each having 25 participants. The participants were followed for a week. Two women were excluded from the study because they did not want to continue. Thus, the study was left with 48 participants; 24 in group A and 24 in group B. Clinical data were available for all 48 eligible women who agreed to participate. Mean age of participants was 28.4\u00b14.3 years.
