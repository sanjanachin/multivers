        "text": "Bronchial asthma (BA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of airways for which the effective therapies include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and short-acting \u03b2 2-adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA). Serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) has been reported to reflect the degree of airway inflammation. We, therefore, explored the implication of serum ECP in assessing the efficacy of ICS therapy in BA children. Our prospective randomized control study enrolled 126 BA children and 78 healthy children (the control group). The BA patients were randomly assigned as two groups; 59 children were treated with ICS, twice a day, for three months and 67 patients received SABA inhalation only if necessary. After the 3-month therapy, the serum levels of ECP, endothelin-1, and nitric oxide and the eosinophil percentage (EOS%) in induced sputum were significantly lower in the ICS group, compared with the SABA group, but were still higher than the control group (all P < 0.05). The forced expiratory volume (FEV1%pred) and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) were improved to the levels of the control group after therapy. Pearson correlation analysis presented that higher serum ECP levels were associated with higher EOS% in serum and with lower pulmonary function indices (FEVl%pred and FEV1/FVC). Importantly, the ICS group exhibited higher quality of life scores and lower symptom scores compared with the SABA group (all P < 0.05). ROC results revealed the diagnostic efficiency of serum ECP levels on the efficacy of ICS. In conclusion, measuring serum ECP levels is helpful for assessing the efficacy of ICS therapy in BA children.",

        "text": "Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy is currently the most effective and widely used treatment option for BA (Chung et al. 2009) . Glucocorticoids play an important role in the regulation of the immune system. They are effective anti-inflammatory agents and immune suppressors, which can block several major airway inflammation pathways and prevent the development of asthma (Barnes 2011) . Glucocorticoids have been considered to be the most potent drug for controlling the inflammatory bronchial reaction in patients with asthma (Adcock 2001) . In addition to ICS, it has been observed that short-acting \u03b22-adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA) plays important roles in relieving asthma symptoms (Bauer et al. 2011) . Eosinophils are responsible for combating parasites and infections, and they are also involved in controlling mechanisms associated with allergies and asthma. Their infiltration is an important feature that contributes to the onset of asthma and forms the pathological basis of an asthma attack (Kim et al. 2012) . During an inflammation, the eosinophils in the airways activate and release inflammatory mediators such as histamines, enzymes and toxic proteins after undergoing degranulation. This further contracts the smooth muscle in the bronchus and increases microvascular permeability and mucus secre-tion (Kariyawasam and Robinson 2006; Fulkerson and Rothenberg 2013) . Human eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) is an eosinophil specific granule protein that is secreted during inflammation and infection (Salazar et al. 2014) . A study confirmed that ECP plays an important role in allergic reactions and infections (Yu et al. 2015 ). However, it has been observed that elevated levels of serum ECP have some potent cytotoxic effects. These include airway epithelial injury and shedding, thereby inducing mast cells to release histamine. Consequently, these effects may lead to the development of airway hyper-responsiveness and obstruction (Koh et al. 2007; Bystrom et al. 2012 ). On the bright side, Serum ECP is a specific Eosinophil marker that reflects its activation status (higher ECP means higher Eosinophil activity) (Koh et al. 2007; Bystrom et al. 2011) . Cumulative evidence showed that serum ECP levels are positively correlated with the severity of an asthma attack. Thus, serum level of ECP is of important clinical value for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma (Zedan et al. 2010) . However, there are no current studies reporting whether the change in eosinophil and serum levels of ECP can be used for evaluating the efficacy of ICS therapy. Therefore, in this study the symptom scores were determined by several measurements; serum ECP, total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), two pulmonary function indices, forced expiratory volume in one second forced expiratory volume to the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), eosinophil percentage (EOS%) in serum and induced sputum, and serum level of endothelin-1 (ET-1), and nitric oxide (NO) level before and after ICS therapy. We investigated these parameters in order to illustrate the diagnostic efficiency of serum ECP level on the efficacy of ICS in children with BA, demonstrating serum ECP level were helpful in assisting in more extensive management of diagnosis and treatment for asthma combined with the pulmonary function test.",

A Master Screen Paed instrument (German Jaeger Company) was used for testing the pulmonary function. After the examination, FEV1%pred and FEV1/FVC were measured continuously once the children relaxed for a minimum of 3 times. Variation ratios were less than 5%, and the best values were selected for comparing with the evaluation indicator of FEV1%Pred and FEV1/FVC. Induced sputum EOS% was measured using a JV3655 I ultrasonic atomizer (Devibiss health care equipment (Shandong) Co., Ltd., Linyi, China) whereby patients were asked to inhale 3% hypertonic saline for 15 to 30 minutes. The sputum was collected in separate Eppendorf tubes. After adding a fourfold volume of 0.1% dithiothreitol (DTT) (Jining Bio-technology Co., LTD, Shanghai, China), the samples were vortexed at a relatively low speed for 20-40 minutes then a fourfold volume of phosphate buffer was added for filtering the samples through 300 mesh filters. After undergoing centrifugation at 3,000 r/min for 10 minutes, the supernatants were discarded and pellets were used for smearing, hematoxylin eosin (Jining Bio-technology) staining, and mounting in order to calculate the proportions of various cells. A \u03bcs-2200 automatic blood cell analyzer (Shenzhen Icubio Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) was used for calculating the EOS% value. Serum samples (4 ml) were used for performing the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the total IgE level in peripheral blood (Elisa Biological Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The ET-1 level was detected via the radioimmunoassay method using the kit from the Research Institute of East Asian Immune Technology in the People's Liberation Army General Hospital.

Although these indices were considerably lower than those observed in the SABA group, but were still higher than those observed in the control group. Above results, to a certain extent, were associated with the therapeutic course, remission degree, time, and environment. Glucocorticoids have been observed to inhibit the growth and migration of inflammatory cells, which is helpful for relieving airway inflammation (Ito et al. 2006) . Knowing this, it is rational to investigate how ICS therapy reduces induced sputum EOS%. Along with the decline in the eosinophil number and activation, the serum ECP level secreted by eosinophil reduced significantly. Furthermore, it has been proposed that ET-1 and NO can be of importance in the pathogenesis of BA. Andersson et al. revealed that corticosteroids can reduce lung ET-1 content (Andersson et al. 1992 ). It has also been observed that children with asthma exacerbation had high levels of exhaled NO, which can be rapidly reduced by administering corticosteroid therapy (Baraldi et al. 1997) .",

        "text": "According to our results, some findings suggested that the detection of serum ECP levels combined with pulmonary function tests could contribute to extensive diagnosis and treatment for asthma. Tekcan et al. (2014) demonstrated that serum ECP levels are directly linked with the severity of asthma, which is very helpful in the assessment of asthma control since it is difficult to conduct the pulmonary function test for children. Therefore, this paves the way for an easier diagnostic tool and method that could aid in diagnosing the extent of BA in children. The majority of researchers observed the diagnostic efficiency of serum ECP levels on the efficacy of ICS therapy in children with BA (Zimmerman and Tsui 1993; Bahceciler et al. 2000) . Our study also showed significant changes in serum ECP levels after ICS therapy, which implied that, serum ECP could be used as a prognostic marker for evaluating BA in children and ICS treatment. Therefore, we proposed that serum ECP levels could serve as a useful maker in the determination of the severity of asthma inflammation, in hopes of providing physicians with an objective evaluation reference for ICS treatment. It is generally believed that airway hyper-responsiveness stimulated by allergen exposure triggers asthma (Fixman et al. 2007) , and the first airway response is by eosinophils, which are the effector cells (Kim et al. 2012) . IgE antibody binds to the allergens and activates the effector cells, which consequently causes them to release various mediators, and results in the contraction of bronchial smooth muscles and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Gould et al. 2003) . Thus, the total serum IgE can be used as an indicator to predict the outcome of asthma therapy. A previous study indicated that the IgE levels were positively correlated with the severity of asthma (Bachert et al. 2012) . This relationship was also supported by our study in that, after ICS therapy, the level of IgE decreased following remission of asthma. Pulmonary function of children before and after ICS therapy were also scored on the basis of FEV1%pred, FEV1/FVC, and observed that, in the ICS and SABA groups, the values of FEV1%pred and FEV1/ FVC increased significantly after therapy. Additionally, patients who underwent ICS therapy showed signs of an improved life quality in regards to their sleep quality. Furthermore, we noticed that the pathological features of ICS-treated patients reduced compared to the SABA group. The statistical data obtained was in support of that ICS could indeed improve pulmonary function as well as improve the ability of patients to performing their daily activities, leading to a better life quality. After therapy, quality of life scores increased for all parameters, while the symptom scores decreased significantly in both ICS and SABA groups. In the ICS group, the quality of life scores was all higher while the symptom scores were lower compared to the SABA group. This suggested that ICS therapy might be a better alternative treatment option than SABA.",
