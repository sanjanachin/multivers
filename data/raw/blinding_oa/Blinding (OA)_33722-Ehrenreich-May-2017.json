These intervention principles include: (1) understanding and gaining greater awareness of emotions and emotional experiences; (2) preventing emotional avoidance and practicing present-focused awareness by engaging in graduated emotion-evocation exercises; (3) increasing cognitive flexibility and linking thoughts to sensations; (4) challenging negative and anxious appraisals related to internal and external threats using antecedent cognitive reappraisal techniques; and (5) identifying and modifying maladaptive action tendencies through various exposure and activation techniques. These intervention principles are believed to influence emotional disorder intensity and impairment via changes in emotion reactivity and regulation, as well as behavioral avoidance. Treatment techniques are applied to a range of emotions including sadness, anxiety, fear, and anger in order to increase the individual's ability to generalize skills across a variety of affective states. While the theoretical basis and content of the UP-A is consistent with the UP, developmentally appropriate modifications were made to create this treatment protocol.

All participants in the multiple-baseline trial investigation experienced a reduction in the severity of their principal anxiety and/or depression diagnosis at post-treatment (Ehrenreich et al., 2009) , and there were significant reductions in principal disorder severity from pre-to post-treatment during the open-trial, as well as improvements in parent ratings of adolescents' emotion regulation (Trosper et al., 2009) . The present study builds upon the current evidence base for the UP-A by evaluating initial outcomes of a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of the UP-A in a sample of adolescents diagnosed with at least one DSM-IV emotional disorder. Primary outcomes included changes in clinician-rated disorder severity, parent-and adolescent-rated emotional disorder symptoms, and functional impairment. It was hypothesized that adolescents receiving immediate UP-A treatment would outperform adolescents randomized to a delayed-treatment waitlist condition on all measures at: 1) a mid-treatment (8-week) time point; and 2) post-treatment.

The sample size was relatively small, which may have limited statistical power to detect treatment effects for some outcome measures; however, the use of multilevel modeling may have attenuated these concerns given the increased statistical power compared to traditional tests (e.g., repeated-measures ANOVA). In addition, although our sample was clinically heterogeneous and presented with a high degree of diagnostic comorbidity, a majority of participants presented with a principal DSM-IV anxiety disorder. Future work with a larger proportion of adolescents with a principal depressive disorder is warranted. Our use of a waitlist control rather than an active comparison condition should also be considered as a limitation, although as previously mentioned, a more robust test of the UP-A's effectiveness is already underway comparing the UP-A to usual care treatment in community settings. Additionally, although our decision to limit the duration of the WL condition to eight weeks is justifiable given the need to balance clinical and ethical considerations with research aims, we acknowledge that this decision conflates time and treatment and limits our ability to ascertain the comparative effect of the full dose of UP-A at 16 weeks. Lastly, we used a relatively short follow-up period (6 months), and given the known high chance of relapse in this population (e.g., Ginsburg et al., 2014) , future work should follow subjects for longer intervals after treatment. In addition, although there was substantial subject attrition from end-of-treatment to the follow-up assessment, the use of estimation procedures with multilevel modeling partially attenuated these concerns.",
