Methods: Unvaccinated HIV-infected children were randomized to receive 3 doses of double dose (N=27) or standard dose (N=28) of recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine. Anti-HBs antibody titres were measured 3 mo after the last dose. An antibody titre \u226510 mIU/mL 12 weaks after the third dose was considered as serporotection. Result: Seroprotection was achieved by 17 (60.7%) children in standard dose group against 20 (74%) in the double dose group [RR (95%CI) 0.8 (0.17-1.7); P=0.29]. CD4 count < 500 cells/mm 3 was significantly associated with lower rates of seroprotection. Conclusion: Double dose of hepatitis B vaccine does not seem to provide any advantage when compared to standard dose in HIV-infected children.",
