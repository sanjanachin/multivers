Methods: This is a randomized, double-masked non-inferiority trial. Children in grades 7 and 8 (age 12-15 years) in nine Chinese secondary schools, with presenting visual acuity (VA) \u22646/12 improved with refraction to \u22656/7.5 bilaterally, refractive error \u2264\u00c01.0 D and <2.0 D of anisometropia and astigmatism bilaterally, were randomized to receive ready-made spectacles (RM) or identical-appearing spectacles with power determined by: subjective cycloplegic retinoscopy by a university optometrist (U), a rural refractionist (R) or non-cycloplegic self-refraction (SR). Main study outcome was global score on the National Eye Institute Refractive Error Quality of Life-42 (NEI-RQL-42) after 2 months of wearing study glasses, comparing other groups with the U group, adjusting for baseline score. Results: Only one child (0.18%) was excluded for anisometropia or astigmatism. A total of 426 eligible subjects (mean age 14.2 years, 84.5% without glasses at baseline) were allocated to U [103 (24.2%)], RM [113 (26.5%)], R [108 (25.4%)] and SR [102 (23.9%)] groups, respectively. Baseline and endline score data were available for 398 (93.4%) of subjects. In multiple regression models adjusting for baseline score, older age (p = 0.003) and baseline spectacle wear (p = 0.016), but not study group assignment, were significantly associated with lower final score. Conclusion: Quality of life wearing ready-mades or glasses based on selfrefraction did not differ from that with cycloplegic refraction by an experienced optometrist in this non-inferiority trial",

Weaknesses must also be acknowledged: enrolled schools were not selected using a random sampling technique, and all were drawn from a single region in southern China. For this reason, application to other populations must be made with caution. Although spectacle wear rates were >95% in all of the study groups, and we did use a previously validated (Ma et al. 2014 ) educational intervention to improve glasses wear, <10% of children reported wearing their glasses all day, which might be expected to reduce the impact of glasses on quality of life. Modest rates of spectacle use are widely reported for children in many settings (Esteso et al. 2007; Ma et al. 2014 ), and we wanted to assess the impact of these different types of correction on quality of life in real-world settings.",

Our finding of non-inferiority with respect to the main outcome, quality of life, builds on previous publications (Zeng et al. 2009; He et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011) showing good visual results in children with these alternative modes of refractive correction. Additional research is needed to assess the acceptability of adjustable spectacles for actual wear among children and adults and also to test models for how these modalities can be used in actual service delivery programmes.",
