The pluripotent progenitor cells contained within autologous adipose tissue grafts are believed to induce skin repair and improve scar appearance. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of fat grafts on the appearance of mature burn scars. Methods: Pediatric burn survivors with mature scars were recruited for this study. A homogeneous scar measuring 10\u00c25cm was randomized into two halves: one was injected with autologous fat graft and the other with normal saline. Scar injection was performed using standard Coleman technique. Appearance of the two scar halves was assessed, six to twelve months later by the operating surgeon, by blinded observers and by the blinded patients. Results: Eight patients completed the study pilot with 6-12 month follow-up. Assessment by the patients did not clearly favor fat grafts or saline injections; the operating surgeon did not identify any differences on any of the patients; the blinded observers measured all scars using Vancouver Scar Scale and noticed no differences in pigmentation, vascularity and height; differences in pliability showed similar changes in both the fat grafted and control arms. After the pilot was completed, decision was made to stop enrolling patients for this study since no benefit to fat grafting was observed. Conclusions: Single treatment with autologous fat grafts did not improve mature pediatric burn scars when compared to normal saline injections.",

The Institutional Review Board approved the study with an enrollment goal of fifty patients and a provision to perform an initial evaluation of safety and efficacy after the first 10 patients were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included pediatric patients with late effects of burns requiring surgical reconstruction procedures who also had mature burn scars that were separate from the primary surgical site, age less than 21 years and with ability to assent to participate in the study. Patients with significant medical problems or American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status Classification System score>II indicating increased anesthesia risk were excluded from this study. Patient's age, ethnicity, gender, age of the scar, scar site, scar dimensions and fat graft donor site were recorded. Appearance of the two scar halves was assessed, six to twelve months later during their scheduled follow up visit, by a blinded independent evaluator using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). Additionally, the scar halves were evaluated by the patient, who was also blinded to the treatment, using a subjective questionnaire asking the patient to compare the \"look\" and \"feel\" of the two sides. During scheduled reconstructive surgery, a separate mature burn scar not in proximity to the area scheduled for surgery was selected for treatment in the study. The study required a homogeneous appearing scar measuring no less than 5\u00c210cm that could be divided into two similar appearing halves measuring 5\u00c25cm each. One half of the scar was injected with 5mL of autologous fat grafts and the other half was injected with 5mL of saline solution. Randomization was used to select the scar half to be injected with either fat or saline. The two scar halves were marked as side A and B and then a sealed envelope was opened in the operating room to see which side would be treated with fat and which with saline. Adipose tissue was harvested from the abdomen in all but one patient where it was harvested from the thigh because the abdomen had extensive scars and did not appear as a suitable donor site. The lipoaspirate was then centrifuged for 3min at 3000RPM and the cells were transferred into 1mL syringes for grafting. Scar injection was performed using standard Coleman technique. Of note, a 1-mL syringe with an 18-gage needle was used for fat grafting, as opposed to a blunt tip cannula, in order to allow grafting into dense scar tissue. The amount of volume of fat or saline injected was 5cc in each scar half and both sides were injected using an 18 gage needle. In order to prevent any differences on scar maturation that could be triggered by the trauma of the needle, the operating surgeon infiltrated both sides of the scar with an effort to make a similar amount of needle passes on each side.",

Perhaps a larger study would have revealed many other patients where fat grafts led to successful improvement of the mature burn scars.
