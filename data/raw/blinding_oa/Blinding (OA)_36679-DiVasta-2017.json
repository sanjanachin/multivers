        "text": "We sought to determine whether low-magnitude mechanical stimulation (LMMS) normalizes bone turnover among adolescents hospitalized for anorexia nervosa (AN). Brief, daily LMMS prevents the decline in bone turnover typically seen during bed rest in AN. LMMS may have application for patients with AN in the inpatient setting to protect bone health. Introduction Malnourished adolescents with AN requiring medical hospitalization are at high risk for rapid reduction in skeletal quality. Even short-term bed rest can suppress normal patterns of bone turnover. We sought to determine whether LMMS normalizes bone turnover among adolescents hospitalized for complications of AN. Methods In this randomized, double-blind trial, we prospectively enrolled adolescent females (n = 41) with AN, age 16.3 \u00b1 1.9 years (mean \u00b1 SD) and BMI 15.6 \u00b1 1.7 kg/m 2. Participants were randomized to stand on a platform delivering LMMS (0.3 g at 32-37 Hz) or placebo platform for 10 min/ day for 5 days. Serum markers of bone formation [bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP)], turnover [osteocalcin (OC)], and bone resorption [serum C-telopeptides (CTx)] were measured. From a random coefficients model, we constructed estimates and confidence intervals for all outcomes. Results BSAP decreased by 2.8% per day in the placebo arm (p = 0.03) but remained stable in the LMMS group (p = 0.51, p diff = 0.04). CTx did not change with placebo (p = 0.56) but increased in the LMMS arm (+6.2% per day, p = 0.04; p diff = 0.01). Serum OC did not change in either group (p > 0.70). Conclusions Bed rest during hospitalization for patients with AN is associated with a suppression of bone turnover, which may contribute to diminished bone quality. Brief, daily LMMS prevents a decline in bone turnover during bed rest in AN. Protocols prescribing strict bed rest may not be appropriate for protecting bone health for these patients. LMMS may have application for these patients in the inpatient setting.",

However, extremely low-level strains on bone, similar to those caused by muscle contractions during postural control, are anabolic to bone tissue. High-frequency LMMS delivered via vibrating platform can inhibit bone loss and preserve BMD in at-risk populations [16, 18, 32] In a 6-month trial, children with cerebral palsy exposed to LMMS showed +6.3% increases in tibial vBMD from baseline; children who stood on placebo devices had an 11.9% decline [18] . In adolescents with existing low BMD and a history of fracture [33] , subjects receiving LMMS for at least 2 min/day had increased spinal trabecular vBMD (+3.9%) compared to control subjects and poor compliers. A similar study performed in persons of advanced age (mean 83 years) yielded disappointing results; changes in total femoral trabecular vBMD and mid-vertebral trabecular vBMD did not differ between LMMS and placebo groups after 24 months [34] . Reasons for the lack of efficacy may include a lack of mechanical sensitivity/ responsiveness of resident bone cells in the elderly skeleton, or a reduced number of available progenitors in the bone marrow. In animal studies, LMMS can bias fate selection of bone progenitors, driving them toward osteoblasts rather than to adipocytes [35] . This effect may be the mechanism of the beneficial effect of LMMS in AN, since these patients exhibit premature conversion of hematopoietic to fat cells in the marrow of the peripheral skeleton and potentially have adipocyte over osteoblast differentiation in the stem cell pool [36] . These hypotheses highlight the importance of early intervention for patients while the skeleton is still responsive.",

However, completers did not differ from those with incomplete data with regard to baseline characteristics. If all participants had been retained until the end of the study, the differences between groups may have even been greater than we observed. Large increases in nutrient intake occurred during the study, leading to significant weight gain.

As all subjects were \u22652 years post-menarche, results may not be generalizable to pre-menarchal girls.

The duration of exposure to bed rest and to the LMMS intervention was brief. The length of the study was determined by the average clinical length of stay for medical admissions for anorexia nervosa at our institution. As discussed above, other trials conducted in human subjects have been of much longer duration (6 or 12 months). Longer exposure to the LMMS intervention would be required to demonstrate an effect on less dynamic measures of skeletal health, such as bone density, bone geometry, or fracture risk. The results of this pilot study should be confirmed by a randomized, controlled trial of longer duration to determine whether bone density and quality can be restored and to explore metabolic outcomes.

While it remains unclear whether this restoration of bone turnover will ultimately benefit the skeletal phenotype, there is evidence that musculoskeletal health can improve in adolescents with such signals, and without serious adverse events.
