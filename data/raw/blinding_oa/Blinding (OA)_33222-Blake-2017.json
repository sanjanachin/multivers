We also examined whether benefits to sleep and anxiety would be mediated by improvements in sleep hygiene awareness and presleep hyperarousal. Methods: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial conducted with 123 adolescent participants (female = 60%; mean age = 14.48) who had high levels of sleep problems and anxiety symptoms. Participants were randomized into a sleep improvement intervention (n = 63) or active control \"study skills\" intervention (n = 60).

Results: The sleep intervention condition was associated with significantly greater improvements in actigraphy-measured sleep onset latency (SOL obj), sleep diary measured sleep efficiency (SE subj), PSQI, SCAS, SBS, and PSAS, with medium to large effect sizes. Improvements in the PSQI and SCAS were specifically mediated by the measured improvements in the PSAS that resulted from the intervention.

However, recent reviews have suggested that while these psychoeducational programs are effective in increasing students' knowledge about sleep, they are less effective in improving sleep behavior or mental health. [17] [18] [19] These findings are consistent with research showing that simple sleep hygiene education does not guarantee positive outcomes in adults 20 , and that targeted interventions are more effective than universal interventions in preventing child and adolescent mental health problems. 21 In sum, these findings suggest that active sleep interventions that incorporate supported decision-making tools and that are delivered to students who are already experiencing early signs of sleep and mental health problems may be more effective. 22 There is emerging evidence that adolescent sleep problems can be treated effectively using cognitive behavioral therapies. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as a first-line treatment for adult insomnia 23 , based on evidence from multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses that the intervention improves sleep and mental health in adults, with small to medium effect sizes. [24] [25] [26] [27] However, only nine trials have evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral sleep interventions among adolescents. Two were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 28, 29 , one was a prospective RCT 30 , and six were uncontrolled feasibility trials. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] All the interventions incorporated core elements of CBT-I (eg, sleep hygiene instruction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring), and some included added treatment components (eg, mindfulness, savoring, anxiety/depression specific components). In general, the interventions were associated with meaningful improvements in self-reported and objective sleep and functional outcomes (daytime sleepiness, depression, and anxiety) within active treatment conditions. As with adults, improvements tended to be stronger for wakefulness in bed variables compared to sleep duration variables and self-reported sleep variables compared to objective sleep variables. [24] [25] [26] However, the trials were limited in several ways, including small sample sizes [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , lack of control groups [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , wait-list control groups 28, 29 , high attrition rates 29, 32 , lack of follow-ups 31, 34 , short follow-ups 28, 35, 36 , and/or reliance of self-reported measures of sleep. 29, 33, 34 The SENSE study is an RCT investigating whether a 7-week, cognitive behavioral, and mindfulness-based group sleep intervention can prevent the emergence of major depressive disorder (MDD) at 2-year follow-up among a group of adolescents (aged 12-17 years) who were experiencing elevated levels of sleep problems and anxiety symptoms. 37 Strengths of the SENSE study are the large sample size, the well-defined manual-driven treatment consisting of components demonstrated to improve sleep in prior research, the time-and format-equated active control \"study skills\" condition, and the use of both self-reported and objective measures of sleep duration and quality. We have previously reported the postintervention effects of the intervention on sleep and internalizing symptoms. 38 Results showed that the sleep intervention condition (Sleep SENSE) was associated with significantly greater improvements in objective and self-reported SOL, perceived sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and anxiety compared to the active control condition (Study SENSE), with small to medium effect sizes.

Second, we predicted that compared to the Study SENSE intervention, the Sleep SENSE intervention would decrease symptoms of anxiety and improve sleep hygiene awareness and presleep hyperarousal. Third, we predicted that benefits to both sleep and anxiety on school nights would be specifically mediated by the measured improvements in sleep hygiene awareness and presleep hyperarousal that resulted from the intervention. We analyzed school night sleep because of the well established discrepancy between weekday and weekend/holiday sleep habits in adolescents 2 and because presleep arousal is more likely to occur on school nights. 44 Previously, we reported sleep averaged across the week. 38 Objective sleep was measured using wrist actigraphy and self-reported sleep using sleep diaries and questionnaires.

(b) At the screening, preintervention and postintervention phases, participants also completed the PSQI. 59 The PSQI is a self-report inventory designed to assess self-reported sleep quality and disturbances and the impact of poor sleep on daytime functioning.

        "text": "This study provides evidence, using a methodologically rigorous design, that a cognitive behavioral and mindfulness-based group sleep intervention can improve self-reported and objective indices of sleep on school nights among at-risk adolescents, particularly SOL and SE, with medium effect sizes. These results are consistent with emerging empirical evidence showing that anxious adolescents have particular difficulties with sleep initiation 42, 43 and with the results of other cognitive behavioral sleep interventions, which have also found relatively larger improvements in wakefulness in bed variables compared to sleep duration variables. 24, [29] [30] [31] [32] 34, 36 As we have previously reported 38 , the study also provides evidence that a cognitive behavioral and mindfulness-based group sleep intervention can improve anxiety among at-risk adolescents, with small effect sizes, consistent with research showing that adult CBT-I results in small improvements in anxiety symptomatology. 27 Furthermore, the study provides evidence that a cognitive behavioral and mindfulness-based group sleep intervention can improve sleep hygiene awareness among at-risk adolescents, with large effect sizes, consistent with research showing that school-based sleep intervention programs lead to improvements in students' knowledge about sleep and insomnia. [17] [18] [19] However, the magnitude of the effect size found in the current study was larger than those reported in RCTs of school-based sleep education programs. 70, 71 This might be due to several factors. The Sleep SENSE interventions were personally tailored, more intensive, had a key focus on engagement and reviewing key information to increase retention and recall, and provided adequate opportunities to practice techniques in session and at home. The interventions were also targeted at students who were more likely to benefit from the programs and who were therefore more likely to be motivated, ready for change, and to identify with content. Finally, the study provides evidence that a cognitive behavioral and mindfulness-based group sleep intervention can improve presleep arousal (cognitive and somatic) among at-risk adolescents. This finding is consistent with research among adults. Electrophysiological, autonomic, neuroendocrine, neuroimmunological, neuroimaging, daytime performance, and experimental studies have consistently shown that adults with insomnia display heightened cognitive and somatic arousal. 11 Several studies have also shown that cognitive and somatic arousal decrease from pretreatment to posttreatment among adults who complete CBT-I. 41 Moreover, cross-sectional studies have shown that adolescents report elevated arousal in the presleep period.
