Interventions that seek to reduce truancy problems range from school-based police officers to programs that reward good attendance to community-based interventions. This study reports primary outcome results of a randomized trial of a collaborative, police-school partnership that sought to reduce truancy and increase students' willingness to attend school. Using school attendance and students' self-report survey data, we find that the police-school partnership intervention shows promise for reducing truancy and improving students' willingness to attend school. We conclude that policeschool partnerships that foster the willingness of young people to attend school should be examined in future evaluation research and be considered in the development of truancy prevention programs.",

For the ASEP, this legal provision was the aforementioned Education (General Provisions) Act. Together, police and school leaders in the target district wanted to implement a collaborative, sustainable program that explained the legal escalation framework to the truants and their parents in a way that would raise awareness of the truancy laws, foster perceptions of the legitimacy of the laws, empower participants to willingly re-engage with school, and thereby, increase their school attendance. Recognizing that truancy often co-occurs with a range of risk factors within the individual, family, schools, and community (see Kearney 2008b for a review), the police and school leaders adapted a family group conferencing approach (Connolly and Masson 2014) as the primary vehicle of the intervention, using the conferencing format to (1) identify psychosocial issues contributing to the young person's nonattendance at school, (2) raise awareness of truancy laws, and (3) create an Action Plan to support families' efforts to re-engage the student with school.",

If such confounds did indeed occur (e.g., change in teacher), they may have either attenuated or accentuated the intervention's impact on truancy. Finally, the program intervention was narrowly focused. While the Action Plans broadly sought to address key issues contributing to truancy through referring families to appropriate social services, the intervention could not address complex underlying causes of truancy across students, which could have included community, family, peer, or individual stressors. We recognize, therefore, that some students and/or families will require complementary interventions that go well beyond the program to adequately alleviate the psychosocial issues often underlying truancy (Maynard et al. 2013; Sutphen et al. 2010) .",

            "While the Action Plans broadly sought to address key issues contributing to truancy through referring families to appropriate social services, the intervention could not address complex underlying causes of truancy across students, which could have included community, family, peer, or individual stressors.",
            "We recognize, therefore, that some students and/or families will require complementary interventions that go well beyond the program to adequately alleviate the psychosocial issues often underlying truancy (Maynard et al. 2013; Sutphen et al. 2010) ."

This is no easy feat in a context of resource constraints and often competing priorities, processes, and structures. Even with their shared goal of reducing truancy, building a productive partnership in order to work with at-risk families required planning, frequent and transparent communication, and a willingness to compromise. Our experimental results suggest that a partnership with clear and shared goals can aid in the reduction of social problems. Gittell (2006) similarly finds that partnerships are most effective when the parties engage in frequent communication, enjoy shared goals and knowledge, and demonstrate mutual respect (see also Crawford and L'Hoiry 2015). Our results concur with these findings, yet we suggest that shared truancy reduction goals are best realized within the context of a structured (as opposed to unstructured) partnership, with a clearly defined intervention process. Indeed, the fact that the schools and police in the experimental locale had mutual goals to reduce the problem of truancy, yet did not previously work together in a productive manner, underpinned the need for a new, structured approach to the partnership.",

The feasibility of the approach in the long-term will depend on the willingness and commitment of schools, police, and other social support agencies to maintain a partnership and allocate resources to address a common problem. However, implementation is not dependent on having a designated school-based police officer or truant officer, and the intervention model is relatively straight forward, time-efficient, and replicable. It involved a short engagement between school and police representatives, who were brought together in a brief conference forum to discuss each student's truancy, communicate with the parents the laws around truancy (and their legal responsibilities), and collaboratively develop an Action Plan to facilitate re-engagement with school. We see from our results that this straightforward, yet collaborative, approach appears to promote increased school attendance and willingness to attend school. The relative simplicity and clear structures of ASEP may therefore assist in establishing a sustainable, effective approach to reduce truancy and potentially change the life course of truanting young people (Attwood and Croll 2015; Hancock et al. 2013; Rocque et al. 2016) .",
