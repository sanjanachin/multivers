        "text": "Objective: To evaluate the tolerability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of extended-release guanfacine in children with chronic tic disorders, including Tourette's disorder (collectively referred to as CTD). Methods: This was a multisite, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome measure was the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) total score. Key secondary outcomes included the Improvement item of Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale and the Tic Symptom Self-report (TSSR). Adverse events were monitored at each visit. Results: Thirty-four subjects (23 boys and 11 girls) of ages 6 to 17 years (mean = 11.1-3.1) with CTD were randomly assigned to extended-release guanfacine (n = 16) or placebo (n = 18). At baseline, the mean YGTSS total score was 26.3-6.6 for the guanfacine group versus 27.7-8.7 for the placebo group. Within the guanfacine group (mean final daily dose of 2.6-1.1 mg, n = 14), the mean YGTSS total score declined to 23.6-6.42 [t(15) = 1.84, p = 0.08; effect size = 0.35]. The results were similar in the placebo group with a score of 24.7-10.54 at week 8 [t(17) = 1.83, p = 0.08; effect size = 0.38]. There was no significant difference in the rate of positive response on the CGI-I between the guanfacine group and placebo (19% [3/ 16] vs. 22% [4/18], p = 1.0). The most common adverse events were fatigue, drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, and irritability. Two subjects in the guanfacine group discontinued early-one because of an adverse event (depressed mood) and one because of lack of efficacy; two subjects in the placebo group discontinued because of lack of efficacy. Conclusions: This pilot study did not confirm a clinically meaningful effect size within the guanfacine group. These results do not support the launch of a larger efficacy trial for tics in children and adolescents with CTD.",

However, among the small subgroup of children with a diagnosis of ADHD (n = 12), we did not observe significant improvement on ADHD outcomes. We are limited by the small size of this subgroup to determine whether children with comorbid CTD and ADHD might have a significant response to extended-release guanfacine, both with regard to tics and ADHD symptoms.
