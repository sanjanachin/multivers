We compared the analgesic effect of 25% glucose and non-nutritive sucking in newborns undergoing hepatitis B vaccination. Our hypothesis is that 25% glucose is more effective in relieving pain than non-nutritive sucking. Methods: A randomized clinical trial with 78 healthy newborns was performed. Neonates were assigned randomly to receive 25% glucose (G25) and non-nutritive sucking (NNS). Pain was assessed using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) before and during the immunization procedure. In addition, we evaluated various physiological parameters and crying time. Results: Neonates who received 25% glucose registered lower NIPS scores than those from the NNS group [mean (SD), 3.3 (2.1) vs. 5.6 (1.6), p < 0.001]. The crying time was shorter among newborns in the G25 group than in the NNS and control groups. Conclusion: The use of 25% glucose before the vaccination procedure was more effective in relieving acute pain, with newborns in the G25 group registering scores two times lower on the NIPS scale. The clinical practice of administering 25% glucose is therefore a suggested nondrug measure for pain relief during painful procedures. Significance: Neonates who received 25% glucose registered lower NIPS scores than those from the NNS group; the crying time was shorter among newborns in the G25 group than in the NNS and control groups; the use of 25% glucose before the vaccination procedure was more effective in relieving acute pain.",

However, there was no evidence of any benefit of the combination of glucose and non-nutritive sucking compared with glucose or non-nutritive sucking (Shah et al., 2015) . The proportion of children crying was higher in the group who received non-nutritive sucking compared with 25% glucose group. Studies have shown that patients who have used glucose solution exhibited lower crying intensity than did infants in the control group (Liu et al., 2010; Hall and Anand, 2014; Shah et al., 2015) . Furthermore, Ravishankar et al. (Ravishankar et al., 2014) also observed that infants receiving a glucose solution exhibited shorter crying times during nasogastric probe procedure. Similar analgesic effects were observed in studies using sweetened solutions (Liaw et al., 2011; Kassab et al., 2012; Sahoo et al., 2013) . Thus, 25% glucose is an effective analgesic to reduce both the intensity and time of crying. Furthermore, it can also contribute to the reduction in irritability and stress, and thus comfort the newborn. On the other hand, a decrease in crying time can promote modulation of alertness and minimize physiological and behavioural changes (facial movements, muscle relaxation and state of consciousness). Crying is a form of communication among newborns and it is important for health professionals to assess the crying type characteristics associated with other behavioural indicators.",
