The posterior tibial artery is one of the terminal branches of the popliteal artery and begins at the level of the lower border of the popliteus muscle. The artery passes behind the medial malleolus and terminates by dividing into the medial and lateral plantar arteries. At the midpoint between the medial malleolus and the Achilles tendon, the posterior tibial artery is covered by the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and flexor retinaculum, and it is easily palpable, even in patients in the prone position. 15 The posterior tibial artery has extensive collateral connections with arteries in the foot, including the anterior tibial artery, which continues to the dorsalis pedis artery, and the peroneal artery. 21 From the first observational study, the most remarkable anatomical findings were that the posterior tibial artery has a larger diameter and cross-sectional area. The inner diameter of the posterior tibial artery was larger than 1.1 mm, which is the outer diameter of the 20-gauge angiocatheter. If an operator uses a 22-gauge angiocatheter, the potential occlusion might be much less. The larger diameter of the posterior tibial artery might have several advantages, including an increased cannulation success rate and fewer complications. The incidence of thrombosis and arterial obstruction are related to the percentage width of the catheter within the arterial lumen. 8, 22 In addition, the dorsalis pedis artery, which is usually selected for arterial cannulation in the foot, Fig. 4 . Schematic diagram of arteries in 234 pediatric patients in the prospective randomized controlled study with relative depth from the skin surface, diameters, and cross-sectional area. The diameter of the posterior tibial artery ([PTA]; 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm) was similar to that of the radial artery ([RA]; 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 mm) and larger than that of the dorsalis pedis artery ([DPA]; 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 mm; P < 0.001). The posterior tibial artery was located deeper (3.3 \u00b1 1.2 mm) compared with the radial (2.6 \u00b1 1.0 mm; P = 0.013) and dorsalis pedis arteries (2.5 \u00b1 1.0 mm; P = 0.001). Posterior Tibial Artery for Arterial Cannulation showed a significant blood pressure gradient with measurement at the radial artery owing to its small diameter. 14, 23 However, the posterior tibial artery was located slightly deeper than the radial and dorsalis pedis artery. Position changes, ankle dorsiflexion, and eversion significantly increase the proximity to the skin surface, 4 mm below the skin surface in small children. The depth from the skin surface probably influences the success rate of arterial cannulation. Nakayama et al. 3 reported that the optimal depth from the skin surface is 2 to 4 mm during ultrasound-guided arterial cannulation. Whether the depth from the skin surface of the posterior tibial artery affects the success rate of arterial cannulation needs further investigation.",

Using the real-time ultrasound-guided long-axis in-plane technique, the first-attempt success rate of posterior tibial artery cannulation was similar to that of the radial artery, time to cannulation was lesser than it was for dorsalis pedis artery cannulation, and the rate of posterior arterial wall puncture was significantly reduced. The posterior tibial artery has several advantages for ultrasound-guided arterial cannulation, such as the large diameter of the artery, deep location from the skin surface, and ease of ultrasound probe placement during cannulation. Owing to the groove between the medial malleolus and the Achilles tendon, the ultrasound probe position can be maintained, and handling of the ultrasound probe and cannulation was easier than that of the radial and dorsalis pedis arteries ( fig. 3) . In addition, the deeper location of the posterior tibial artery makes the artery noncompressible when the ultrasound probe is manipulated.",
