Aims: The present study examines what effect a parent-administered early intervention program applied to preterm infants in a randomised control trial (RCT) between 34 and 36 weeks gestational age has on their fidgety movements and overall movement character at three months of age. Study design: The study was part of the RCT in an early intervention programme including preterm infants born between 2010 and 2014 at three Norwegian university hospitals. Subjects: 130 preterm infants participated in the study, with 59 of them in the control group and 71 in the intervention group. Outcome measures: Fidgety movements and overall movement character at three months corrected age. Results: No difference was found between the intervention group and the control group in terms of fidgety movements or movement character. Approximately half of the infants in both groups showed an abnormal movement character. Conclusion: No evidence was found in this RCT to suggest that an intervention at 34 to 37 weeks gestational age has a significant effect on the fidgety movements or overall movement character of preterm infants. This is in line with the assumption that absent fidgety movements and an abnormal movement character are due to permanent brain injury and are therefore good predictors for later neurological impairments.",

A description of the study design was previously published [28] . The purpose of the RCT was to evaluate the effect of customized physiotherapy on preterm infants' motor development. Performed by parents during a period of three weeks while their infants resided at the NICU, the intervention integrated key elements from the modified version of the Mother-Infant Transaction Program as well as elements from interventions in other studies that have shown a positive effect on preterm-born children's motor development [28] . The main principles of intervention were to promote symmetry and midline orientation in different positions while supporting the child's own activity. The handling and motor stimulation was carried out according to Girolami and Campbell [29] and the social interaction between the parent and the infant as described by Kaaresen et al. [30] . Postural support was given to facilitate the infant's midline orientation as a base for social interaction and for increasing the infant's variation of movements. Each infant performed at least one activity in each of the following positions: prone, side-lying, supine, supported sitting, and in transition between positions. A detailed list of 15 activities has been published [28] . Examples of parental intervention include activating neck flexors, shoulder and abdominal muscles, assisting the child to bring their arms forward and guiding them from supine to upright sitting. The intervention was individualized based on the infant's level of development and tolerance for movement. The parents were taught to support and facilitate activity and to adapt their support to the infants' response. They were given a booklet with photos and written descriptions of activities implemented in different positions. Intervention time was limited to 10 min twice a day at 34, 35 and 36 weeks PMA. The intervention was stopped if the infant's behavioural state did not allow interventioni.e. if they were fussing, falling asleep, hungry, or showed signs of stress. The parent kept a daily log to record the time and duration of intervention. The motor development of all infants was assessed at regular intervals between three and 24 months corrected age, including videos recordings of their GMs. The final endpoint of the study is motor development at 24 months corrected age.",

Most infants in the intervention and control groups showed presence of fidgety movements, and in any case a significant effect of the intervention on the group of infants with absence of fidgety movements would have been hard to identify because of the small number of infants in this group. There is no evidence to suggest that the intervention had any effect on abnormal movement character, which has been previously reported to be a characteristic and prevalent finding in infants born preterm [18, 33] . The high prevalence of abnormal movements in preterm-born infants was confirmed in the study, with as many as approximately half of the infants in either group showing an abnormal movement character. These results corroborate the assumption that an abnormal movement character like absence of fidgety movements is due to a permanent brain lesion that cannot be easily changed by intervention. These findings are in line with previous studies according to which an abnormal movement character at three months of age indicates later motor and/or cognitive impairment [14] . According to Hadders-Algra [27] , the complexity and variation of GMs are possibly brought about by the transiently present cortical subplate. Abnormal GMs could be the result of damage to or dysfunction of the subplate and its efferent motor connections in the periventricular white matter. White matter damage occurring before term age leads to a loss of axons and subplate neurons, thus impairing thalamo-cortical connections [36] . The notion that the quality of GMs is based in particular on the integrity of the subplate and its connections may also explain abnormal GMs occurring around three months post term in some infants born preterm. The time lapse between a potential impairment of the subplate and the subsequent absent fidgety movements could be explained by the gradual disappearance of the subplate between 36 weeks post-menstrual age and 3 to 6 months post term, which corresponds to the final phase of GM development [27] .",
