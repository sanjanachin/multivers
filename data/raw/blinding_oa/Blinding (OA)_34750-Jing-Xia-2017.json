For all subjects, body part adverse reactions and whole-body adverse reactions were observed 30 min, 6 h, and 1-7 days' post-inoculation. If no severe adverse effects were observed 7 days' post-vaccination, the local and systemic reactions of preliminary test participants were recorded until day 28. There was no placebo group in this study. Blood samples were taken for serological testing before vaccination and 28 days' post-vaccination. Results: Twenty-eight days after vaccination, the seroconversion rates of experimental and control groups were H1N1 75.3% and 75.7%, H3N2 75.8% and 71.8%, B 70.7% vs. 69.4%, (P > 0.05). The antibody Geometric Mean Titer(GMT)of experimental and control groups were H1N1 (179.7, 182.4), H3N2 (584.0, 445.7), B (201.4,191.6). The protection rate of experimental and control groups was not statistically significant (H1N1: 86% vs. 87%, H3N2: 99% vs. 98%, B: 98% vs. 98%). Also, 95% confidence intervals of the protection rate difference between the experimental and the control group were H1N1: \u22120.1% (\u22124.1,3.8) %, H3N2: 0.3% (\u22121.0,1.7) % and B: 0.2% (\u22121.5,1.9) %; confidence intervals exceeded the limit of \u22125%. The rates of adverse reactions between experimental and control groups were 6.3% and 7.7% in local response reactions, and 19.5% and 18.0% in systemic reactions. Three hundred and twenty-seven adverse events (AEs) in 1200 (27.76%) subjects were reported within 28 d after vaccination. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Conclusions: The experimental vaccine three-antibody protection rate was non-inferior to the control vaccine. Our results demonstrated that the experimental vaccine achieved the primary immunogenic end point of the intended clinical protocol, as well as a secondary immunogenic end-point, with an acceptable level of safety. IRB approval for this study was issued under #2012Y0005 and registered as Clinical Trial No. NCT01551810.",
