El objetivo del presente estudio fue estudiar la eficacia de la leche de vaca como veh\u00edculo para la suplementaci\u00f3n de VA, zinc y hierro. M\u00e9todos: trescientos veintiocho ni\u00f1os en edades entre 6 y 10 a\u00f1os fueron incluidos en un estudio aleatorizado controlado, doble ciego durante 23 semanas; 173 ni\u00f1os recibieron diariamente 480 mL de leche entera (300 Kcals; G1) y 155 ni\u00f1os recibieron leche entera fortificada (300 Kcals, G2). Los ni\u00f1os tuvieron una evaluaci\u00f3n nutricional antes y despu\u00e9s de la suplementaci\u00f3n. Al inicio del estudio, G1 y G2 fueron similares en g\u00e9nero, edad, peso, y talla. Los dos tipos de leche fueron bien aceptados. Resultados: las concentraciones s\u00e9ricas de VA, zinc y hierro aumentaron significativamente en ambos grupos despu\u00e9s del tratamiento. El aumento de estos micronutrientes fue significativamente mayor en los ni\u00f1os con deficiencias. No hubo diferencias significativas en las concentraciones de VA, zinc y hierro entre los grupos despu\u00e9s de la suplementaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, hubo un incremento en el porcentaje de ni\u00f1os con IMC-normal dependiente de una disminuci\u00f3n en el n\u00famero de ni\u00f1os con exceso de peso al final del periodo de tratamiento en G1, mientras que en G2 no hubo cambios. Los perfiles lip\u00eddicos fueron normales antes y despu\u00e9s de la suplementaci\u00f3n con leche en los dos grupos. Conclusiones: en resumen, tanto la leche fortificada como la no fortificada son excelentes opciones para aumentar las concentraciones de VA, zinc y hierro en escolares.",
