The booklets evaluated in this study aimed to promote such self-management by drawing on evidencebased approaches to promoting well-being. The lack of impact suggests that using booklets as a medium to convey these self-management strategies is not effective. We should temper our conclusions by highlighting the fact that we did not have direct records regarding booklet usage. An unfortunate, but necessary, compromise in a study of this scale was the limited depth of data collected from any school or individual child. This means that the current pragmatic study design cannot untangle the impact of uptake or the type of use from the efficacy of the materials themselves. Although students were significantly more likely to report seeing the booklets in the schools where they were provided, we do not know whether the booklets were read or the information in them was used. It may be that the impact of the booklets by those who used them was obscured by limited usage overall. It is also plausible that the booklets would be more effective when used in a targeted way (e.g. with the support of the pastoral care team) rather than simply being made available for students to pick up. Whilst there were no differences in primary schools, in secondary schools, children at risk of mental health problems were slightly more likely to report seeing the booklets compared with low-risk children.
