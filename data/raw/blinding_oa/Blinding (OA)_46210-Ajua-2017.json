        "text": "Background: The malaria vaccine RTS,S induces antibodies against the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the concentration of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against the repeat region of CSP following vaccination is associated with protection from P. falciparum malaria. So far, only the quantity of anti-CSP IgG has been measured and used to predict vaccination success, although quality (measured as avidity) of the antigen-antibody interaction shall be important since only a few sporozoites circulate for a short time after an infectious mosquito bite, likely requiring fast and strong binding. Methods: Quantity and avidity of anti-CSP IgG in African infants who received RTS,S/AS01 E in a 0-1-2-month or a 0-1-7-month schedule in a phase 2 clinical trial were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody avidity was defined as the proportion of IgG able to bind in the presence of a chaotropic agent (avidity index). The effect of CSP-specific IgG concentration and avidity on protective efficacy was modelled using Cox proportional hazards. Results: After the third dose, quantity and avidity were similar between the two vaccination schedules. IgG avidity after the last vaccine injection was not associated with protection, whereas the change in avidity following second and third RTS,S/AS01 E injection was associated with a 54% risk reduction of getting malaria (hazard ratio: 0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22-0.99) in those participants with a change in avidity above the median. The change in anti-CSP IgG concentration following second and third injection was associated with a 77% risk reduction of getting malaria (hazard ratio: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.11-0.51). Conclusions: Change in IgG response between vaccine doses merits further evaluation as a surrogate marker for RTS,S efficacy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00436007.",

        "text": "Malaria has an enormous public health impact and new preventive interventions are urgently needed. After more than 100 years of research on malaria vaccines, RTS,S was the first pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidate that entered phase III clinical development [1] [2] [3] . RTS,S contains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) together with a fusion protein of HBsAg and a carboxy-terminal fragment of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP), co-expressed in yeast and formulated with a proprietary adjuvant (AS01). The exact mechanism of RTS,S-mediated protection is not known, although Immunoglobulin G antibodies (IgG) against the CSP repeat region are likely to play an important role since the concentration of anti-CSP IgG partly explains protection in most studies that assessed efficacy of RTS,S in African children [4] [5] [6] . In addition, passive transfer of anti-CSP IgG can protect animals from subsequent challenge [7, 8] . Besides concentration, many other properties determine antibody function. Among them are availability of effector molecules, post-translational modification, isotype, subclass, affinity and avidity of antibodies. It is difficult to measure all these characteristics in one sample, particularly in the small sample volumes obtained during clinical trials in infants. Affinity, defined as the strength of interaction between an epitope and an antibody binding site, would be a particularly interesting variable to measure in the context of anti-CSP IgGmediated immunity, since the time of interaction with the parasite is short (less than 30 minutes [9] ), sporozoites are strongly diluted and few. In fact, only one successful hepatocyte infection is sufficient to initiate and maintain blood stage infection. Studies in mice have shown that high antibody affinity against a synthetic CSP immunogen is positively associated with protection [8, 10] and most studies in humans indicate that anti-CSP IgG concentration explains only parts of the vaccine-mediated protection. Increase in antibody affinity after repeated antigen exposure is the result of affinity maturation due to somatic hypermutation. The rate and extent of maturation may be influenced by several factors, including nature, route and dose of the antigen, adjuvants and carriers as well as the immunization schedule. In the present study antibody avidity was measured. It is a representation of the strength of interaction between antibodies and antigens in a complex and besides antibody affinity, valences of antibodies and antigens as well as structural features of the complex are important determinants of avidity. For CSP, it has been shown that the use of some adjuvants can increase the avidity of anti-CSP IgG after vaccination of human volunteers [11] . In this study IgG avidity against the repeat region of CSP was measured after the second and third injection of RTS,S/AS01 E in infants that received the vaccine as part of a phase IIb clinical trial to assess safety and efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 E in the age-group targeted by the expanded programme on immunization (EPI) [5, 12] .",

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention arms: 1) RTS,S/AS01 E as three injections, one month apart (0, 1, 2 months schedule [012]; n = 170), 2) RTS,S/AS01 E extended schedule (0, 1, 7 months schedule [017]; n = 170) or 3) control (EPI vaccines alone; n = 171). Malaria was defined as parasitaemia >500 parasites per \u03bcl and an axillary temperature >37\u00b0C. The efficacy of RTS,S against first malaria episodes, detected by passive case detection, was equivalent in the two schedules one year after the third injection. The study followed Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki (4 th revision) and received approval from the appropriate local and national ethics committees of each site. In addition, ethical review by the ethics committees of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Ethic Committee, the Swiss Tropical Institute Committee and the Western Institutional Review Board was sought.

Regardless of the vaccination scheme and site, avidity did not improve prediction over anti-CSP IgG concentration alone. This may mean that: i) the assay is not sensitive enough to reflect avidity; ii) collinearity between antibody concentration and avidity blurs the effect of avidity; or, iii) that avidity is not an important determinant of vaccine efficacy. In this study IgG concentration and avidity was measured after the second and third vaccine injection. This approach is valid to assess if the immune system reacted to vaccination successfully. Since kinetics of IgG vary over time and the study was performed under natural exposure to malaria parasites, the time of encounter with the parasite becomes an important variable. This is in contrast to controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies, where the time of infection is defined. Hypothetically, the difference in IgG concentration (and avidity) between second and third vaccination could be a better predictor of effective antibody-mediated protection than concentration after the third vaccine injection, because it better reflects the further evolution of antibody responses until next parasite encounter. The present data argue for the use of this approach since it was shown that a high dCSP predicts protective efficacy and dAI explains part of the protection in the RTS,S vaccinated children (Model 3). How AI evolves over time and if it is a useful predictor of vaccine efficacy remains to be validated with further, independent and confirmatory studies.",
