The program has six group sessions delivered by trained psychologists to parents of 3-to 6-year-old children. An online adaptation (Cool Little Kids Online) has been developed to overcome barriers to its wide dissemination in the community. This study tested the efficacy of Cool Little Kids Online in a randomized controlled trial. Method: A total of 433 parents of a child aged 3 to 6 years with an inhibited temperament were randomized to the online parenting program or to a 24-week waitlist. The online program has 8 interactive modules providing strategies that parents can implement with their child to manage their child's avoidant coping, reduce parental overprotection, and encourage child independence. Parents were provided telephone consultation support with a psychologist when requested. Parents completed selfreport questionnaires at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks after baseline. Results: The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement over time in child anxiety symptoms compared to the control group (d \u00bc 0.38). The intervention group also showed greater reductions in anxiety life interference (ds \u00bc 0.33\u00c00.35) and lower rates of anxiety disorders than the control group (40% versus 54%), but there were minimal effects on broader internalizing symptoms or overprotective parenting. Conclusion: Results provide empirical support for the efficacy of online delivery of the Cool Little Kids program. Online dissemination may improve access to an evidencebased prevention program for child anxiety disorders.",

Automated rules determine whether the rest of the symptom questions for that disorder are presented. Parents rate child anxiety symptoms and level of interference in closed questions, and also provide written descriptions of child thoughts and behaviors and examples of life interference. Initially, responses are automatically scored for the presence or absence of a disorder based on DSM-IV criteria. De-identified reports that include each parent's responses and provisional diagnoses are then reviewed by a psychologist to ascertain whether parents' written descriptions are consistent with the disorder being assessed and whether the level of impairment described is clinically sufficient to warrant a diagnosis.",

        "text": "This study aimed to evaluate an Internet-delivered parenting program for early intervention in anxiety problems in young children. Results provide empirical support for the efficacy of online delivery of the Cool Little Kids program. As hypothesized, the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in child anxiety symptoms and life interference from anxiety, along with lower rates of anxiety disorders, than the control group. Average improvements were small to moderate in size relative to controls, consistent with other anxiety prevention programs delivered to children at greater risk. 12 The number needed to treat to achieve a reliable response or to prevent an anxiety disorder was approximately 6 to 7. Parent satisfaction was high, even though the amount of program use was relatively low. The program, however, did not demonstrate improvements in broader child internalizing symptoms or overprotective parenting. Overall, these results suggest that offering online access to the program with minimal support could be an effective way of reducing anxiety in children with an inhibited temperament. These results add to evidence of the efficacy of the Cool Little Kids program. This study found a difference of 14% in the rate of anxiety disorders between the intervention and control groups, equivalent to the 1-year follow-up result in the first RCT of the group program. 14 Intervention group reductions in anxiety symptoms were also similar in size to those shown in the second RCT at 6-month follow-up, 15 but the effect on anxiety disorders was smaller in the present trial. Compared to the pilot evaluation of Cool Little Kids Online, this study found larger withingroup effect sizes, even higher parent satisfaction, and more frequent homework practice. 23 Online program use was lower than the high attendance rates observed for the group parenting program when delivered through a university research clinic. 14, 15 Adherence rates were closer to those found in translational research, in which the group program was delivered in preschool services and only onethird of parents attended most sessions (Bayer et al., in preparation). These differences in program adherence among clinical, community, and Internet-based populations may reflect different levels of parent commitment. Compared to the clinic-based evaluations of Cool Little Kids, parents could easily sign up for this Internet-based study, as they were not required to commit to laboratory observations and in-person assessments, and hence motivation levels may have been lower.",

        "text": "Although the program was effective overall, there was variation in children's outcomes, and an important minority (42%) did not demonstrate reliable improvement. There is therefore room to further improve program effects, and to identify those families who are least likely to benefit from this method of delivery and why. The lack of effect on internalizing symptoms was unexpected, and the reason for this finding is unclear. The limited effect on overprotective parenting could be due to several factors. One is that there may be natural improvement over time as children start school and are given more independence by parents. Alternatively, as much of the content targeting overprotection begins in the fourth module, some parents may not have received an adequate dose to realistically achieve change in parenting behavior. However, the lack of effect on overprotective parenting does raise important theoretical questions about program mechanisms, which could be investigated in further mediation research. 14 A key area of future research is to explore which families are most likely to benefit from the program and under what conditions. Evidence of effectiveness despite limited use of the program may be a realistic reflection of the nonclinical sample, and some families may not need to learn all of the skills and complete all eight modules. Alternatively, changes to the program could be required to increase adherence or engagement with the material. More frequent assessments could identify when improvements occur and whether these are related to particular modules or skills. Changing the model of clinician support is another avenue of investigation, as the low take-up of this was surprising. Other research has found higher rates of 19% to 48% when clinician support was offered on-demand to support self-guided treatment of anxiety. 35, 36 However, the program was promoted as a resource to prevent anxiety and to improve child confidence, and parent expectations about the need for clinician support may differ from those of online treatment programs for clinical anxiety. In-depth qualitative research could investigate adherence and the reasons for nonuse, and whether these barriers would be feasible to overcome through changes to the program or the provision of support. The value of changing the module structure (e.g., fewer modules), clinician support model, or program components could then be evaluated to optimize the design and delivery of the program. 37 This study has several strengths. It achieved a large sample representing a range of sociodemographic characteristics and a low attrition rate for an online study. The study design was quite pragmatic in that the intervention was delivered in a way similar to how it could be used in practice if disseminated. There were minimal inclusion/ exclusion criteria, the online enrollment process presented few barriers to participation, and participants were not restricted from accessing other help or resources during the study. A limitation of the study was the use of singleinformant self-report measures. Use of other informants (e.g., teachers) would have reduced the risk of bias from parents being aware of their group allocation. However, this was not feasible to implement due to the Australia-wide geographic distribution of participants. The waitlist control also precluded investigating longer-term preventive effects, which may be particularly important given the young age of the children and the increased onset of anxiety in middle childhood. A third limitation was that the assessment of child anxiety diagnoses used a new measure with limited established psychometric properties.",
