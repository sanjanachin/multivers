        "text": "Background: Children and adolescents affected by HIV are at elevated risk of depression, yet research on related interventions in this population is scarce in sub-Saharan Africa. This study sought to examine the effects of interpersonal psychotherapy for groups (IPTG) on depressive symptomology among orphaned and vulnerable adolescents in South Africa. Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial wherein adolescents ages 14-17 enrolled in community-based programming for HIV-affected and vulnerable families were randomly assigned by geographic cluster to participate in a 16-session IPTG intervention or the standard of care (n = 489). Baseline and postintervention surveys conducted with enrollees included standardized depression screening. Utilizing an intent-to-treat design, mixed effects models were performed to examine treatment effects for all participants and potential moderators including gender and baseline depression level (Clinical Trials registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02386878). Results: While 23% of adolescents in the intervention group did not attend any IPTG sessions, average attendance was 12 out of 16 possible sessions among participants. The intervention was not associated with changes in depression symptomology. Conclusions: Results underscore the importance of mitigating participation barriers prior to intervention roll-out and the need for increased evidence for psychological health interventions to mitigate depression among orphaned and vulnerable adolescents. This intervention and the study selectively targeted at-risk adolescents versus using diagnostic mental health criteria for enrollment; more research is needed to identify the potential benefits and disadvantages of these approaches. Key Practitioner Message \u2022 Children and adolescents who have been orphaned due to AIDS or who are living with a chronically ill parent are at increased risk for depression; the need for effective interventions is high in generalized HIV epidemic settings like South Africa. \u2022 Interpersonal psychotherapy for groups (IPTG) delivered by lay practitioners has been evaluated in other populations in sub-Saharan Africa and found to be an effective method for treating depression. \u2022 Results from this cluster randomized controlled trial did not find IPTG delivered by community workers to be measurably associated with changes in depression symptomology among orphaned and vulnerable adolescents, regardless of gender or preexisting depressive symptomology. \u2022 The study took place within the context of rapid program expansion with a cadre of relatively inexperienced facilitators, which may have affected the results; nevertheless, such implementation challenges are common when scaling up interventions in resource-constrained environments.

Longitudinal research from the West has illustrated that parental depression contributes to depression symptoms among offspring (Lieb, Isensee, H\u20ac ofler, Pfister, & Wittchen, 2002) and can moderate the effectiveness of psychological treatments for adolescents (Garber et al., 2009) . Future research should investigate the role of these factors on treatment outcomes among HIV-affected adolescents in order to identify the most effective pathways for mitigating depression in different contexts. This study enrolled orphaned and vulnerable adolescents with varying depression levels, which should also be considered when interpreting the results of this trial. The inclusion of both depressed and nondepressed individuals in the groups may have impacted the results. (Young, Mufson, & Davies, 2006a; Horowitz, Garber, Ciesla, Young, & Mufson, 2007; Bolton et al., 2007; Young, Mufson, & Gallop, 2010) . However, recent evidence has found no significant differences in overall effects between selective programs such as this one targeted to orphans and other vulnerable children, and indicative or universal depression prevention programs (Merry et al., 2012) . Further, offering the intervention without baseline mental health criteria is consistent with other timelimited structured peer-support group interventions for orphans in sub-Saharan Africa that have shown positive effects on depression (Kumakech et al., 2009; Thurman et al., 2017) . Screening using depression inventories or other detailed diagnostic criteria requires a significant investment of time and resources which may impede implementation and scale-up for organizations working in under-resourced contexts. Alternatively, limiting the intervention to only depressed individuals via prescreening might plausibly offset these costs and could result in stronger effects. Ultimately, more research is needed to understand the benefits and disadvantages of targeting only the most severely affected adolescents. Study limitations might also mask treatment effects. The study was not powered to detect independent effects by gender or baseline depression scores. Further, prior research highlights the value of preliminary work to adapt depression scales based on cultural considerations (Bolton, Wilk, & Ndogoni, 2004 ), a process not used in this study due to limited time to intervention roll-out. While the CES-DC has a successful history of use with South African youth (Martin et al., 2014; Thurman et al., 2017) , additional research including local validation with representative community samples is needed to establish appropriate CES-DC cutoff points among adolescents in this context. A prior study of IPTG in the United States suggests that alternative depression inventories may be even more sensitive to change, and advocates for the use of multiple instruments (Horowitz et al., 2007) .",

The proportion of adolescents assigned to receive IPTG who failed to attend any sessions was higher in this study compared to a similar one from Uganda: 23% versus 13% (Bolton et al., 2007) . Participants in the Uganda trial may have been more motivated to attend for a variety of reasons, including the fact that they were symptomatic for depression at enrollment. In this study, baseline depression levels were similar between attendees and nonattendees, suggesting the influence of other factors on attendance. Prior application of IPTG among adults living with HIV in South Africa also resulted in low uptake, with participants' conflicting responsibilities reportedly contributing to complete nonparticipation in half of those assigned to the intervention (Petersen et al., 2014) . Measures such as preintervention orientation workshops for caregivers and adolescents, designed to identify barriers to participation for preemptive response, may help implementers mitigate these issues. Further, devising a shorter and more highly structured version of IPTG may increase the feasibility of widespread uptake in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from multiple studies in the United States highlight the potential for a briefer eightsession IPTG model to effectively promote psychological health while decreasing resource needs for implementers and lowering the participation burden for enrollees (Swartz, Grote, & Graham, 2014) . Program partners should work with practitioners and researchers to develop and test a shortened IPTG model applicable to sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, the study was conducted following rapid program scale-up. Mechanisms to ensure implementation fidelity were not overseen by the researchers, in contrast to the Uganda trial (Bolton et al., 2007) . This study captured World Vision South Africa's first experience delivering IPTG in these communities; time and experience may contribute to increased effectiveness. A variety of new local implementation contexts, many of them resource-constrained, and the pace and scope of scale-up likely contributed to variation in the level of program quality and fidelity to the original model.

Results from this trial did not suggest that a 16-week IPTG intervention was effective. Rapid, extensive intervention scale-up immediately preceding the study was one of several factors that may have played a role in these results. However, findings simulate results that may be expected in real-life settings and suggest useful priorities for future studies. More research is needed to identify best practices for targeting psychological health interventions to adolescent subgroups, especially in areas where risk factors for depression are common, and for maximizing important aspects of implementation such as promoting optimal participation rates.
