It was developed for the promotion of oral health in people of lower socioeconomic status who live in remote areas of developing countries, where dental treatment is not readily available. 9 The ART technique conventionally involves the use of only hand instruments to remove carious tooth structure, and the tooth is then restored with a glass ionomer cement (GIC). 9 This technique is well accepted by children, since it is less anxiety provoking and one of the minimally invasive procedures to prevent tooth mortality. 4, 9, 10 The ART technique works against bacteria in the cavity wall through the bacteriostatic effect of the glass ionomer and the sealing capacities of the filling material. This material forms a physical barrier, preventing potential nutrients essential for growth from reaching the bacteria under the restoration. 11 However, dental hand instruments alone do not remove carious dentin effectively, and cariogenic bacteria can survive under GIC restorations. GICs are capable of releasing flouride ions, which provide a significant anticariogenic property, but this property alone is not sufficient for reducing bacterial counts that remain in the cavity after an ART procedure. 12 Consequently, cavities treated by ART may have residual infected dentin, and if GIC is unable to arrest the carious process, the restoration may fail. 13 The role of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus in initiation and progression of dental caries is well established. [14] [15] [16] Various concepts have been used to reduce or eliminate these microorganisms underneath GIC restorations, such as the addition of antibacterial agents to GIC or application of cavity disinfectants following cavity preparation. 17 Hence, the purposes of this study were to: (1) compare whether the use of chlorhexidine (CHX) cavity disinfection after hand excavation of dental caries, or incorporation of CHX diacetate into the restorative material itself, had any effect on cultivable microorganisms; and (2) determine which of the two methods was more effective in reducing the microbial flora compared to the conventional atraumatic restorative treatment procedure.",

        "text": "Pretreatment of the cavity preparation surface with an antibacterial agent is useful in eliminating the harmful effects caused by the residual bacteria. Because of its antibacterial action, CHX application to cavity preparation prior to placement of the restoration can be carried out. 25, 26 Hence, a one percent CHX solution was selected as the disinfecting agent for the present study. The concentration of CHX used as cavity disinfectant (one percent) and the incorporation of CHX into the restorative material itself (one percent w/w) cannot be directly compared to each other since the duration of contact with the residual microbes and probable longevity of inhibitory action may vary. The most suitable concentration of CHX as a cavity preparation disinfectant tested by previous researchers [25] [26] [27] [28] ranges between one to two percent; the most appropriate concentration of CHX that can be incorporated into glass ionomer cement and that gives a better antimicrobial property without compromising physical property, is one percent w/w. 12, 21 In the present study, one percent of CHX was used in both experimental groups either as a cavity disinfectant or a material incorporated into restorative cement for the purpose of standardization. A significant load of microorganisms was recovered from the infected dentin sample at baseline. Mean TVC counts were in the range of 1.52 to 1.70 (10 5 CFU per ml) in three study groups. LB ranged between 1.55 and 1.91 (10 5 CFU per ml), and SM ranged between 1.50 and 1.67 (10 5 CFU per ml). After ART excavation of carious lesions, sample number two showed a significant reduction of microbes in all three groups, suggesting that hand excavation is effective in reducing bacterial load. This finding has been substantiated by several past researchers studying ART. 5, 29, 30 Hence, the efficacy of the ART procedure itself was quite successful in reducing the bacterial counts of a carious lesion; however, it failed to eliminate them completely. 5, 30 Mean microbial counts at three months follow-up (sample three) showed further reduction of TVC, LB, and SM in all the three groups. However, the mean microbial counts for sample three were significantly less in Groups 1 and 2 versus Group 3. Overall reduction of SM for Groups 1 and 2 was 82 percent and 79 percent, respectively; for Group 3, it was 68 percent. This suggests that the use of CHX containing GIC and CHX cavity preparation disinfection was more effective in reducing the residual cariogenic bacteria under ART restorations. The results were comparable to that observed by other researchers from the past literature. 6, 12, 31, 32 Overall microbial reduction was more in Group 1 with CHX incorporated into conventional GIC compared to Group 2 with CHX cavity preparation disinfection, but the difference was not statistically significant. This difference may be due to continuous availability of CHX in Group 1 compared to Group 2. 6, 31 Although better in efficacy, incorporation of chlorhexidine in a restorative material is difficult, unless provided in such a form by a manufacturer.",
