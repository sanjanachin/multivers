The Family Rewards program, launched by the Center for Economic Opportunity in the Mayor's Office of the City of New York in 2007 and codesigned and evaluated by MDRC, offered cash assistance to low-income families to reduce economic hardship. The cash rewards were offered to families in three key areas: children's education, family preventive health care, and parents' employment. Results that rely on the random assignment design of the study find that Family Rewards resulted in statistically significant reductions in adolescent aggression and rates of substance use by program group adolescents as well as their friends, relative to adolescents in the control condition, but no statistically significant impacts on adolescent mental health. One possible mechanism for the benefits to adolescent behavior appears to be time spent with peers, as fewer adolescents in the program group spent time with friends and more adolescents in the program group spent time with family.

In short, each of the incentive offers (in the three domains of education, health, and employment/training) is thought to induce a small set of incentivized behaviors in the short term (e.g., in school attendance and attendance at parent-teacher conferences; in doctor's and dental visits and the maintenance of health insurance; and in parents' participation in employment and training). These incentivized behaviors were thought to lead to changes in key mediating processes such as (a) the way in which children spent their time and who they were with during their out-of-school time; (b) interactions between parents and children; and (c) children's approach to schooling (e.g., engagement and motivation). Beneficial effects were also thought to occur as a result of the short-term increases in income that families experienced from their receipt of the rewards.

First, the financial incentives may improve families' economic resources, which have implications for children's outcomes (both the targeted outcomes, such as health and academic achievement, as well as non-targeted outcomes). A number of studies, both experimental and nonexperimental, have pointed to the association between income and cognitive outcomes for children, and, while less consistently, higher income has also been found to improve children's mental health and behavioral development (although somewhat more consistently for conduct problems than internalizing dimensions; Costello et al. 2003; Gershoff et al. 2005; Milligan and Stabile 2007) . Second, the effects on mental health and problem behavior may occur indirectly as a function of improved academic achievement, which is directly targeted by the incentives (and for which prior findings show positive impacts, although only for a subgroup of adolescents). Increased academic efficacy and competency has been found to be associated with increased self-esteem and reduced mental health and problem behavior (Roeser et al. 1999; Roeser et al. 1998) .

Parents may also engage their children in tutoring or other achievementoriented after-school activities that might increase children's likelihood of achieving the greater payments attached to children's test scores.

At the same time, there were statistically significant reductions in three of the four areas of problem behavior with effect sizes ranging from 0.13 to 0.35 (see the third panel of Table 2, and 1 We present OLS for both continuous as well as binary and categorical outcomes, to ease interpretation. Results from probit and logistic regression models show substantively the same results as those presented here. 2 Other studies on this sample, including the companion study (Aber et al. 2016) , have used p < 0.10 (p < 0.05 in each tail) to determine significance, given convention in policy and education science. In this paper, consistent with other studies in the prevention science field, we treat p < 0.05 (p < 0.025 in each tail) as statistically significant. the F value of the omnibus MANOVA was statistically significant for this domain; F = 2.20, p = 0.009). While there were no differences between program and control groups in the frequency of delinquent acts or in rates of delinquency, there were statistically significant reductions in frequency of aggression (0.12 compared to 0.20 on a scale of 0 to 3, p < 0.05) and rates of any aggressive behavior (14.1% compared to 24.1%, p < 0.001). And, there were statistically significant reductions in the frequency of adolescents' substance use (1.10 compared to 1.19 on a scale of 1 to 4, p < 0.001), as well as rates of any substance use (17.5 compared to 32.6%, p < 0.001), and the number of friends who used substance (1.81 compared to 1.99 on a 1 to 4 scale, p < 0.01). When use of individual substances were examined separately, there was a 13.6 percentage point reduction in the percent of adolescents who reported ever drinking alcohol in the previous month (12.9% compared to 26.6%, d = \u22120.34, p < 0.001) and a 6.9 percentage point reduction in the percent of adolescents who reported ever using marijuana in the previous month (6.6% compared to 13.5%, d = \u22120.23, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant reductions in the rates of adolescents who ever smoked cigarettes in the past month or every used hard drugs in the past month (although the frequency of cigarette use was significantly reduced in the program group, not shown). Similarly, when examining peer use of alcohol and drugs, there were reductions in the reported number of peers using alcohol and marijuana (d = \u22120.21 and \u22120.25, respectively), but not in peers using hard drugs (although the rate of use is quite low). 3 3 Despite differences in impacts for adolescent academic outcomes for those adolescents who were more and less academically prepared for school, there were no statistically significant differences in the impacts on these mental health or problem behavior outcomes for these subgroups; nor by child gender (findings available from the authors).
