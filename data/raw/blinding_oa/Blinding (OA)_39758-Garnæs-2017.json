Our aim was to investigate if exercise during pregnancy in overweight/obese women could influence birth weight or other neonatal and maternal outcomes at delivery. Material and methods This is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial of exercise training in pregnancy for women with body mass index (BMI) ! 28 kg/m 2. Ninety-one women (31.3 \u00b1 4.3 years, BMI 34.5 \u00b1 4.2 kg/m 2) were allocated 1:1 to supervised exercise during pregnancy or to standard care. The exercise group was offered three weekly training sessions consisting of 35 minutes of moderate intensity walking/running followed by 25 minutes of strength training. Data from 74 women (exercise 38, control 36) were analysed at delivery. Results Birth weight was 3719 \u00b1 695 g in the exercise group and 3912 \u00b1 413 g in the control group (CI-460.96, 74.89, p = 0.16). Birth weight > 4000 g was 35% in the exercise group and 52% in the control group (p = 0.16). Mean gestational age at delivery was 39.1 weeks in the exercise group and 39.5 weeks in the control group (CI-1.33, 0.43, p = 0.31). No significant betweengroup differences were found in neonatal body size, skinfold thickness, placental weight ratio, or Apgar score. The prevalence of caesarean section was 24% in the exercise group and 17% in the control group (CI 0.20, 2.05, p = 0.57). Mean length of hospital stay was 4.8 days in the exercise group and 4.5 days in the control group (CI-0.45, 1.00, p = 0.45).",

This is in line with several other studies [18, 21, 37, 38] and confirmed by two recent systematic reviews [23, 24] . However, Barakat and colleagues [39] found a 2.5 times higher risk of macrosomia in women allocated to a control group compared to women who adhered to ! 80% to a supervised exercise program of three weekly sessions during pregnancy. In line with this, Hopkins et al. [36] observed significantly lower birth weight among babies born to women who exercised during pregnancy. Both these studies included women of all BMI categories. We observed a tendency of higher prevalence of children with birth weight > 4000 g in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. This finding is supported by a meta-analysis of 5278 newborns born to women in all BMI categories, in which a lower prevalence of macrosomia, despite no difference in birth weight, was observed in women who followed a lifestyle intervention program in pregnancy [40] . Of note, about 50% of the children born to women in the control group had birth weight > 4000 g. Babies with birth weight ! 4000 g are at increased risk for birth complications, childhood obesity, adult obesity, and future metabolic syndrome, compared to babies with birth weight 2500-4000 g [41] .

Data from overweight and obese women in comparable RCTs of Barakat et al. [42] and Nascimento et al. [43] , showed no effect on neonatal birth weight. Exercise interventions showing most effect on neonatal birth weight are characterized by including all weight classes [21, 42, 44, 45] , and by including the participants early in pregnancy (gestational week 6-13) [42, 45] , or by high frequency of exercise sessions (five times per week) [44] . Most RCTs on exercise training in pregnancy make use a combination of endurance training at light to moderate intensity, and resistance training, with duration of the sessions of 45-60 minutes two-three times per week until gestational week 36-38. The amount, intensity and duration of exercise in the ETIP trial are in line with several other randomised controlled trials on exercise in pregnancy, however, the mean inclusion time (gestational week) was higher (16.4) in the ETIP trial, and thus decreases the number of weeks of exercise during the pregnancy.",
