        "text": "Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of bivalved versus circumferential cast immobilization on maintenance of reduction and associated complications after closed reduction (CR) of radius and/or ulna fractures in children. Methods: Two hundred two children with displaced radius and/ or ulna fractures were randomized to either circumferential (n = 101) or bivalved (n = 101) long-arm casts after CR. The mean age was 10 \u00b1 3 years. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex, or initial fracture displacement or angulation. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks postreduction. Radiographic loss of reduction (LOR), need for remanipulation or surgery, and associated complications of compartment syndrome, cast saw injury, and neurovascular compromise were recorded. Results: Overall, the median angulation of the radius and ulna fractures improved from 20 and 18 degrees to 3 and 2 degrees after CR, respectively. The median cast index after reduction was 0.78 in the bivalved group and 0.80 in the circumferential group. The median angulation of the radius and ulna was 8 and 1 degrees at 4 weeks, with no significant difference between groups. By the fourth week of follow-up, 70 patients (34%)-35 bivalved and 35 circumferential-had radiographic LOR. Fortyseven patients (23%)-23 bivalved and 24 circumferentialunderwent remanipulation or surgical reduction and fixation. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to LOR rate or need for surgical treatment. One bivalved patient sustained a cast saw injury, and 3 bivalved patients had transient neurological abnormalities. No patients developed compartment syndrome. Conclusions: Cast immobilization is effective in the majority of patients after CR of displaced forearm fractures. There were no significant differences in maintenance of reduction, need for surgery, or complications between bivalved or circumferential long-arm casts. Level of Evidence: Level I-therapeutic.",

In efforts to avoid loss of fracture reduction and the need for further intervention, great emphasis is placed upon optimizing casting technique, including application of circumferential casts with appropriate 3-point bend or molding. [21] [22] [23] [24] Although CR and casting remain the mainstay of treatment for the majority of skeletally immature patients, circumferential casting is not entirely benign. Given the concomitant soft tissue trauma and swelling, circumferential forearm immobilization carries the risk of neurovascular compromise and/or compartment syn-drome. 25, 26 With impending or evolving neurovascular compromise, prompt cast removal and surgical fracture stabilization is recommended. Although neurovascular compromise is rare, the potential functional consequences are considerable. For this reason, bivalving casts after CR of acute fractures has been advocated.",

These rates are consistent with previously published reports and highlight the inherent risk of late instability in pediatric forearm and distal radius fractures.

Other factors that may contribute to the risk of late displacement include resolution of soft tissue swelling, muscle atrophy during the period of cast immobilization, and suboptimal cast molding. Furthermore, no subgroup analysis was performed to determine the effect of fracture location or single versus both bone injury on fracture stability. Regardless of etiology, patients and families should be counseled regarding the risk of LOR, and serial radiographic follow-up is recommended in the first 2 to 4 weeks after injury.",
