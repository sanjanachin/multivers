Method: The participants were 71 children with significant developmental delays or multiple disabilities randomly assigned to either of the two contrasting approaches to interventions. Results: Findings showed that an intervention which employed practices that built on existing child behaviour (asset-based practices) was more effective than an intervention focusing on teaching children missing skills (needs-based practices) for influencing changes in the rates of child learning as well as rates of child social-emotional behaviour mediated by differences in rates of child learning. Implications: Both the theoretical and practical importance of the results are described in terms of the extended social-emotional benefits of asset-based response-contingent learning games.",

Operant learning games are characterized by behaviour-based contingencies where the availability of a reinforcing consequence is dependent on production of a behavioural response (e.g., child leg kicks making a mobile move and produce sound; child head turns reinforced by a parent smiling and talking to his or her child). Infants without delays or disabilities demonstrate response-contingent learning as early as 2-4 months of age (Lipsitt, 1969) , whereas children with disabilities or delays typically demonstrate contingency learning at somewhat older ages (Hutto, 2007) . Reviews of studies of the response-contingent learning of children with disabilities or delays nonetheless demonstrate the ability to use behaviour to control environmental consequences in a manner much the same as infants without disabilities or delays (e.g., Dunst, Storck, Hutto, & Snyder, 2007d; Dunst, Gorman, & Hamby, 2010a) .",
