This study examined the use of the adult neuroscience-based Sense \u00a9 intervention with children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) to improve upper-limb somatosensory discrimination, motor function, and goal performance. METHOD. Seventeen children with HCP (9 boys, 8 girls; mean age 5 10.2 yr) participated in this pilot matched-pairs trial with random allocation and 6-mo follow-up (intervention, n 5 7; control, n 5 10). The intervention group received Sense training 3\u2022/wk for 6 wk (18 hr). Outcome measures included Goal Attainment Scaling, Sense_assess \u00a9 Kids, and the Assisting Hand Assessment. RESULTS. The intervention group improved in goal performance, proprioception, and bimanual hand use and maintained improvement at 6-mo follow-up. The control group improved in occupational performance by 6-mo follow-up. CONCLUSION. This study established the feasibility of using the Sense intervention in a pediatric setting and adds preliminary evidence to suggest that improving somatosensory function can improve motor function and goal performance among children with HCP.",

The Wrist Position Sense Test is a measure of wrist position sense in which a child's hand is moved through 20 standardized positions on a protractor scale out of the child's sight (Carey, Oke, & Matyas, 1996) . The child indicates where the hand is pointing using a second protractor scale positioned in view immediately above the occluded hand. Psychometric testing continues, but reliability for the Wrist Position Sense Test has been determined for typically developing children using the Bland-Altman method (Bland & Altman, 2010) . Using the Bland-Altman method, Taylor, Parsons, et al. (2017) determined that there were no consistent differences between time points, indicating the measure's reliability. The Sense_assess Kids has normative standards for typically developing children ages 6-15 yr and has demonstrated construct validity and clinical acceptability for children with CP ages 6-15 yr (Taylor et al., 2015; .",

A recent study by Kuo and colleagues (2016) found improvement in tactile outcomes after 82 hr of Hand Arm Intensive Bimanual Training with an additional 8 hr of somatosensory discrimination tasks with objects and shapes. They found that both their treatment (structured tactile tasks, vision occluded) and control (unstructured handling of tactile items, with vision) groups improved on tactile measures, and the authors suggested that the mechanism behind these changes could have been the intensive bimanual training alone or the incorporation of a diverse range of shapes and textures. No follow-up data were presented. The variability in our groups meant that we also had no between-groups differences, and whether the changes in the control group were the result of a learning effect is unclear. However, the absence of a reduction in variability suggests this is not the case, and the agent responsible for the change requires further investigation.",

        "text": "The Sense somatosensory discrimination intervention was associated with an improvement in motor function. Although there were no significant between-groups differences on the AHA, our intervention group demonstrated improvements immediately postintervention that were maintained at 6-mo follow-up, and our control group showed no change over time. Our data suggest that improvements in limb position sense may contribute to improved motor performance because the results on our measure of limb position sense mirrored the AHA results. Kuo et al. (2016) demonstrated improved motor performance on the AHA as well, but improvement was observed in both treatment conditions, and the authors determined that whether the tactile training contributed to improvements in motor performance was not clear. We did not see the same improvement on the B&B Test as we did on the AHA, and both the intervention and the control groups made modest improvements over time. The differences observed between these assessments may be due to differences in the focus of measurement; the AHA measures how the more affected hand is used in bimanual tasks, and the B&B Test solely measures unimanual performance. An important direction for future study will be to understand the elements of somatosensation that most contribute to gains in motor function. This study suggests that limb position sense is modifiable and plays an important role in upper-limb use of children with HCP. Individual variation was observed in both the treatment and the control groups and may have contributed to the absence of statistically significant between-groups change. Variability such as we observed has been reported in studies examining intensive interventions for the upper limb (Eliasson, Krumlinde-Sundholm, Shaw, & Wang, 2005; Hoare et al., 2013; James, Ziviani, Ware, & Boyd, 2015; Sakzewski, Ziviani, & Boyd, 2011) . In these examples, the effectiveness of the intervention was confirmed by within-group analysis while acknowledging the presence of variance. As recommended in a systematic review of upper-limb interventions for children with HCP, it is crucial that future studies examine child characteristics such as severity of impairment, side of hemiplegia, motivation, cognition, and cortical sensorimotor reorganization for their contribution to treatment outcome (Sakzewski, Gordon, & Eliasson, 2014) .",
