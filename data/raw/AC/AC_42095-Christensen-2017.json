Methods: After Institutional Review Board and parental approval, 77 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years were studied in a prospective, double-blind manner and randomized into three groups. Group 1 received intranasal saline, while groups 2 and 3 received 0.1 mL/kg of 0.25% or 0.5% phenylephrine, respectively. All received the same anesthetic of halothane, N 2 O, O 2 , and vecuronium.

This variability is probably attributable to interindividual differences in phenylephrine absorption by the nasal mucosa. Marked interindividual variation in plasma concentration has also been noted in adult patients receiving intravenous phenylephrine infusion 12 and oral phenylephrine. 14, 16 Our data indicate that peak plasma concentrations of phenylephrine are achieved by 14AE7 minutes following intranasal administration.
