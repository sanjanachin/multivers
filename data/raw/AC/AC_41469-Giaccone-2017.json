Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs between 0.4 and 6.8 per 1,000 live births and is associated with a high mortality and morbidity. 1 Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) became a standard of care after the Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study (NINOS). 2 Even in that study, however, there remained a high mortality rate in the iNO group of 14% (vs. 17% without iNO). The mortality rate for newborns with PPHN is between 7 and 9.4%. 3, 4 Importantly, survivors of PPHN also have unacceptably high rates of morbidity; at 24 months follow-up, one or more neurodevelopmental disability was present in 34.5% of survivors. 5 Milrinone, a bipyridine derivative of amrinone, and a phosphodiesterase type III (PDE3) inhibitor, has been suggested as a promising therapy for PPHN. Milrinone induces vasodilation in both pulmonary and systemic arterial beds and acts as a lusitrope, improving diastolic function. The clinical benefit of milrinone was demonstrated in the PRophylactic Intravenous Use of Milrinone After Cardiac OpeRation in Pediatrics (PRIMACORP) trial in which prophylaxis with milrinone reduced low cardiac output state in infants following cardiopulmonary bypass .6 Milrinone and iNO produce a synergistic decrease in pulmonary artery pressure in children and in experimental PPHN. 7, 8 There is increasing empirical use of milrinone in the neonatal intensive care setting in the United States, including in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. 9, 10 For use in PPHN, there are three case series and one pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic study in the literature, none with control group comparisons. [11] [12] [13] [14] It is known that milrinone is cleared by the kidneys with little to no metabolism. Thus, plasma concentration is largely dependent on renal function. However, there is limited PK data for milrinone in newborns. PK studies of milrinone include preterm infants, full-term infants with single ventricle physiology undergoing cardio-pulmonary bypass, and limited data from the PRIMACORP trial. [15] [16] [17] These limited data suggest that neonates and infants demonstrate a lower clearance (CL) and higher volume of distribution compared with adults and children. The single PK study of milrinone in newborns with PPHN used noncompartmental approaches to analysis, making it difficult to assess age as a covariate. 14 The primary objective of our pilot study was to describe the plasma concentrationtime profile of milrinone in infants with PPHN and to explore the impact of age within the first days of life on milrinone disposition. In addition, we aimed to add to the existing clinical, pharmacodynamic, and safety data in order to allowan optimal dosing regimen of milrinone to be developed for further study.",

All models were run with the firstorder conditional estimation with interaction (FOCE-I) method. S-Plus Version 6.2 (Insightful Inc., Data Analysis Products Division, Seattle, WA) was used for goodness-of-fit diagnostics and graphical displays. The goodness-of-fit from each NONMEM run was assessed by the examination of the following criteria: visual inspection of diagnostic scatter plots (observed vs. predicted concentration, observed and predicted concentration vs. time, and weighted residual vs. predicted concentration or time), the precision of the parameter estimates as measured by asymptotic standard errors derived from the covariance matrix of the estimates, successful minimization with at least three significant digits in parameter estimates, changes in the Akaike Information Criterion (minimum value of the objective function plus two times the total number of parameters), and changes in the estimates of interindividual and residual variability for the specified model. Nonparametric bootstrap analysis was performed using NONMEM VII interfaced with PDX-Pop Version 5.0 (ICON) and R Version 2.15.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). One and two compartment models were investigated.
