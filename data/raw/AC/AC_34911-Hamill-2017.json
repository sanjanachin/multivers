Summary of Background: IPLA reduces pain in adult elective surgery. It has not been well studied in acute peritoneal inflammatory conditions. We hypothesized that IPLA would improve recovery in pediatric acute laparoscopic appendectomy. Methods: This randomized controlled trial in acute laparoscopic appendectomy recruited children aged 8 to 14 years to receive 20 mL 0.25% or 0.125% bupivacaine (according to weight) atomized onto the peritoneum of the right iliac fossa and pelvis, or 20 mL 0.9% NaCl control. Unrestricted computergenerated randomization was implemented by surgical nurses. Participants, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was pain score. Analysis was by a linear mixed-effects model. Results: Of 184 randomized participants (92 to each group), the final analysis included 88 IPLA and 87 control participants. There was no statistically significant difference in overall pain scores (effect estimate 0.004, standard error 0.028, 95% confidence interval \u00c00.052, 0.061), and no difference in right iliac fossa or suprapubic site-specific pain scores, opioid use, recovery parameters, or complications. No child experienced a complication related to the intervention. Conclusion: IPLA imparted no clinical benefit to children undergoing acute laparoscopic appendectomy and cannot be recommended in this setting.",

In the presence of pus or contamination, surgeons sprayed after peritoneal lavage, otherwise the timing of spray was at the discretion of the surgeon; in practice, the majority of cases were sprayed after the surgical dissection. The preferred applicator was a 5-mm CoSeal DuploSpray MIS (Micromedics, St. Paul, MN), which consists of luer lock attachments at the handle end, a 5-mm diameter shaft for insertion through a 5-mm port, and a spray tip that atomizes fluid into a mist of droplets. Surgeons attached a 20-mL syringe containing the study solution to one luer lock connector of the device, inserted the shaft through a 5-mm port, and compressed the syringe plunger to atomize the solution onto the peritoneum. This method enabled a controlled directed spray. The study protocol allowed surgeons to instill the study solution through an 8-Fr feeding tube if only 3-mm ports were available, but in practice, surgeons placed 5-mm ports for virtually all appendectomies. If a feeding tube was used, the direction of spray could be controlled by grasping the end of the tube with 3-mm nontoothed forceps. Study documentation that accompanied each participant contained written instructions for surgeons, nurses, and anesthetists. Surgical registrars were coached in the technique by the principal investigator (JKH); however, no video monitoring or other formal quality assessment was undertaken. Standardized surgery involved 3 ports, a 10-mm (occasionally 5 mm) umbilical Hasson cannula and 5mm (occasionally 3 mm) left iliac fossa and suprapubic ports. The study drug was bupivacaine 0.25% if !36 kg or 0.125% if <36 kg. Control was 0.9% NaCl. The volume was 20 mL if !26 kg, and decreased 2 mL for every kg <26 to ensure a total local anesthetic dose including abdominal wall local anesthetic <2.5 mg/kg. The volume calculation was designed to maximize the dose of local anesthetic to the peritoneum while allowing for other local anesthetic administration to the abdominal wall incisions. Standardized analgesia included a rectus sheath nerve block with 10-mL 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:400,000, and port site infiltration with 6-ml 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine, 2 mL at each port site. Standardized anesthesia involved intraoperative morphine up to 0.3 mg/kg, fentanyl 2 mg/kg titrated as required, paracetamol 15 mg/kg, and paracoxib 1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg if not contraindicated. Standardized prophylactic antiemetic was ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg, and dexamethasone if not contraindicated. Standardized postoperative pain management involved regular oral paracetamol 20 mg/kg 6-hourly for 24 hours, substituted with intravenous paracetamol 15 mg/kg 6-hourly for 24 hours if not able to tolerate oral intake; oral tramadol as needed; and intravenous morphine as needed as per institutional protocol.

The protocol optimized standard of care for both groups with local anesthetic infiltration at each port site and a rectus sheath nerve block at the umbilicus, the site of the largest port (10 mm). To maintain safety, we limited the maximum local anesthetic dose in children !36 kg (79% of participants) to 50 mg, with a step down dosing schedule by weight. Of the 3 previous randomized trials in children, 1 instilled 10 mL of 0.2% or 0.75% ropivacaine for children younger than 10 years of =10 years of age respectively, 10 1 instilled 2 mg/kg 0.5% levobupivacaine, 11 and the third instilled 40 mL of either 0.2% ropivacaine or 0.25% levobupivacaine. 12 A systematic review in adult laparoscopic cholecystectomy correlated the concentration of anesthetic used for IPLA with pain scores, finding that the beneficial effect on pain increased as the local anesthetic concentration increased. 37 Although local anesthetic doses administered in the present trial were relatively low, they were consistent with doses used in previous pediatric studies.",

[10] [11] [12] Galante et al 12 added a continuous infusion of local anesthetic via a peritoneal catheter in the postoperative period; their study was set in an intensive care environment. In the present trial, instillation via a feeding tube was allowed, but in the majority of cases the solution was atomized to apply a more uniform coating of anesthetic on the peritoneal surfaces. Two previous studies in children atomized intraperitoneal local anesthetic in a similar manner. 43, 44 Both were retrospective reviews from the same research group. Freilich et al 43 found reduced pain with bupivacaine IPLA in laparoscopic pyeloplasty. Zanetta et al 44 compared atomized spray to nebulization of the local anesthetic with the insufflation gas over a 15-to 30-minute period, reporting lower peak plasma levels of bupivacaine with nebulization. To our knowledge, nebulized IPLA has not yet been studied in a randomized controlled trial in children. In adults, different methods of application of IPLA had no consistent effect on outcomes as shown by a systematic review of randomized trials. 45 The large body of evidence on IPLA in adult surgery has been collated in systematic reviews on laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 4, 5, 37, 46, 47 laparoscopic gastric procedures, 32 laparoscopic gyecologic procedures, 48 and in open surgery. 6 The meta-analyses in these reviews consistently demonstrated reduced postoperative pain after IPLA. The discordance in the number of published studies of IPLA in children compared to adults could suggest bias in the pediatric literature. It is interesting that 2 pediatric articles showing a benefit from IPLA have appeared only in abstract form to date. 12, 44 Limitations of the present study include the above-mentioned limited dose and volume of local anesthetic. The groups were not entirely balanced, with a nonsignificant trend to more perforated appendicitis in the intervention arm. Perforated appendicitis would be expected to engender more pain; however, our data showed no significant difference in pain scores between perforated and uncomplicated cases. We did not measure plasma local anesthetic levels; this has been investigated by others. 32 The timing of the local anesthetic spray was not standardized; most received the intervention after dissection of the appendix. Studies on the effect of timing of IPLA have not yielded consistent results. 45 The intervention technique was not subjected to formal quality assurance. The scrub nurse and 1 circulating nurse were not blinded to the intervention, but blinding was ensured at all other levels of the study; we detected no suggestion of a breach in blinding at any point.",
