Materials and methods: A total number of 99 patients (54 males and 45 females) who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy because of suspected appendicitis between December 2013 and May 2015 were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided in three groups based on instrument used for sealing of mesoappendix: group 1 (Ultracision; n \u00bc 36), group 2 (LigaSure; n \u00bc 32), and group 3 (MiSeal; n \u00bc 31). Lateral thermal damage, intraoperative and postoperative complications, duration of surgery, hospital stay, and economic value were compared within groups. Results: The median age of patients was 14 y (range 3-17). A histopathologic analysis revealed a positive diagnosis of appendicitis in 84 patients (85%). The median lateral thermal damage on appendiceal base using Ultracision, LigaSure, and MiSeal was 0.10 mm, 0.16 mm, and 0.10 mm respectively, and on mesoappendix, 0.08 mm, 0.13 mm, and 0.08 mm, respectively. Significantly higher thermal damage was found on mesoappendix (P \u00bc 0.015) and appendiceal base (P \u00bc 0.012) in patients treated with LigaSure than in patients from other groups. There were no statistical differences among the groups regarding intraoperative and postoperative complications (P \u00bc 0.098). No significant difference in thermal damage between appendicitis and nonappendicitis group was found (P \u00bc 0.266).",

Prevention of the bleeding requires time and appropriate use of technology. Lateral thermal spread of energy results in damage of tissues near the target site and could be seen in every laparoscopic procedure. However, results of studies showed that the newer electrosurgical instruments produce excellent hemostasis and also all produce lateral thermal damage which is less than produced by older instrument. 1, 2 The main issue in open or laparoscopic electrosurgery is to minimize thermal damage to surrounding tissues and to increase speed without compromising integrity of the tissue. 1e3 Although laparoscopic appendectomy has not yet achieved the status of a \"gold standard\" treatment, it is progressively accepted as the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. 4 To achieve safe cutting and hemostasis, different devices for laparoscopic appendectomy have been introduced to clinical practice. 1, 4 Ultracision is an ultrasonically activated instrument which works by the transmission of high-frequency mechanical energy direct to tissue. 3 The heat and vibration together denature proteins by disrupting hydrogen bonds leading to formation of a sticky coagulum. Because of mechanical vibration, Ultracision devices applied less energy than bipolar instrument as well as working in lower temperature. 3 LigaSure is a bipolar instrument which uses new smart generator technology and produces less thermal energy compared with other bipolar instruments. LigaSure causes the fusion of the blood vessels using a unique combination of pressure and current to melt the collagen and elastin contained within blood vessel wall. 5 More recent instrument on market is MiSeal, which uses direct energy for achieving tissue performance. Thermal fusion technology allows precise application of heat and less heat injury. Using this technology, there is lesser blood loss and reduced subjective sense of pain during the first few postoperative days. 6 The purpose of this study was to investigate the degree of lateral thermal injury of mesoappendix and appendiceal base using three different instruments (Ultracision LigaSure, and MiSeal) for dissection and hemostasis during laparoscopic appendectomy in children.",

It works at lower temperatures than other electrosurgical devices (50 C-80 C). 2, 3 The Ultracision, widely used instrument, is a safe and useful device in laparoscopic surgery. Many studies showed that using of the Ultracision during laparoscopic surgery produces less lateral thermal damage and leads to a shorter duration of surgery. Ultracision produces bioaerosols or very small particles and here is no smoke and no electric energy passage through the patient's body. 2, 3, 7, 11 LigaSure is a bipolar vessel sealing system that effectively seals blood vessels up to 7 mm in diameter, lymphatic vessels, and tissue bundles as large as the jaws of the instrument. The working principle of the instrument is sealing collagencontaining tissue by the denaturation of proteins and fusion of the opposing layers, which can then be easily transected. 5, 12 MiSeal in a new instrument which achieves tissue effect using direct thermal energy. The 5-mm laparoscopic instrument consists of reusable headpieces and disposable tip. Less blood loss and less postoperative pain were found using MiSeal during laparoscopic procedure. 6 Comparative study compared thermal fusion energy and bipolar instruments during tonsillectomy and showed that faster coagulation and recovery were achieved by MiSeal than bipolar instruments. 13 Our results did not show superiority of any of the instruments in achieving the hemostasis. This is in opposite with other studies which showed superiority of LigaSure in achieving the hemostasis. 1, 14, 15 Our results showed significant difference in length of operative time between compared groups but without any clinical significance because it was <10 min. The shortest operation time was found in MiSeal group and the longest in Ultracision group. We obtained these results on relatively small number of the patients and with the fact that most of the patients with perforated appendicitis were in Ultracision group, which extends surgical procedure. In our study statistically significant difference in hospital stay between three groups was also found. The longest hospital stay was also seen in Ultracision group because of the same Fig. 2 e Average thermal damage of (A) mesoappendix and (B) appendiceal base among instruments. reason as for the operation time, also without clinical significance. Clinical studies showed shorter operation time for LigaSure in comparison with Ultracision and monopolar electrosurgery in laparoscopic colectomy, adrenalectomy, and liver resection. 16e20 Many studies reported thermal injury after electrosurgical instrument application. 1e3,6e8,10e21 Side thermal injury may result from every used method of coagulation after direct application of the instrument to the tissue or because of insulation failure, direct or capacitive coupling. The ideal instrument would provide excellent hemostatic results with no thermal energy escape from the area where it has been applied. Previously, it has been reported that thermal spread caused by LigaSure and Harmonic scalpel is limited to an area <1.5 mm and 1.6 mm beyond the tissue bundle or vessel, respectively. 1, 3, 21 Ultrasonic energy delivered through a harmonic scalpel has been shown to be safe and to produce minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. High-power ultrasonic dissection may result in considerable heat production and surrounding tissue damage, especially when activation time exceeds 10 s. 2, 3, 11 In our previous studies, it has been demonstrated that harmonic scalpel application times >5 s presented a risk of lateral thermal damage to surrounding tissues or organs. To prevent lateral thermal injury, a 5-s pause between two 5-s applications has been suggested. 2, 3 In our study, patients operated using LigaSure had significantly greater lateral thermal damage of mesoappendix and base of appendix compared with other two instruments used for dissection of mesoappendix. Dru zijani c et al in their study also found greater thermal damage when using LigaSure than Ultracision; but in contrast to our study, that difference was not statistically significant. 20 Others studies showed slightly lesser lateral thermal damage of the tissue when using LigaSure than Ultracision, but also without statistical significance. 1, 20 In our study, lateral thermal damage was also compared between patients with inflammation of an appendix and those without inflammation, to see does the inflammation of the tissue cause difference in thermal damage. Although patients with noninflamed appendix had lower amounts of lateral thermal damage, statistically significant difference in thermal damage between two compared groups was not found.",
