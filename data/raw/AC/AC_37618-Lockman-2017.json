Diagnostics were not available to provide precise information regarding causes of death, leading to uncertainty in mortality rates from standard bacterial pathogens as compared with opportunistic infections (as has been true in other studies from the region). Similarly, the contribution of malaria to mortality in previous studies may have been underestimated, and there are suggestions that the benefit from CTX in these studies was in large part related to reduction in malaria. For example, in a household study in Uganda, CTX prophylaxis in an HIV-infected individual led to significantly lower rates of both malaria and mortality in the entire household, 3 and multiple studies have demonstrated reduced clinical malaria 9, 10, 26, 27 and lower parasite burden 11, 12 in the setting of CTX prophylaxis. As in our study, bacterial resistance to CTX is common throughout Africa, [28] [29] [30] and may have further diminished the benefit of CTX in preventing death from standard diarrheal and respiratory pathogens. In general, little is known regarding the impact of CTX resistance when used for prophylaxis rather than treatment, but it may be of greater concern when prophylaxis is aimed at standard bacterial pathogens as compared with opportunistic infections or malaria. 31 There is recent evidence that the recommended dosing of CTX may result in low CTX levels in up to a third of children, and this may have impacted its efficacy in our study. 32 Lastly, it is possible that adherence affected efficacy of the CTX intervention.
