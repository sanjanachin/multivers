Environmental barriers and challenges outside the home may have been key factors compromising adherence. Given these barriers, the observed increase in water intake may be the best that can be expected among adolescents. Almost one-third of adolescents in the water group reported not being able to drink water in class, presenting a significant barrier to adherence. Furthermore, approximately 40% reported a lack of convenient places to drink water from a fountain or refill a water bottle outside of school or home. These barriers may have limited the ability of our participants to achieve the 8 \u00d7 8 recommendation. Access to drinking water is often compromised in schools owing to older plumbing infrastructure and related cost implications and/or municipal water safety issues. 38, 39 These challenges may also be contributors to the high rate of dehydration among adolescents. 4 Future studies testing the advice to drink 8 cups of water per day for weight loss will need to consider study designs that overcome the environmental barriers associated with the provision and/or accessibility of potable water, such as placement of \"water jets\" (electrically cooled, large clear jugs with a push lever for fast dispensing) in school cafeterias to increase access to drinking water. 40 Strengths of our study include the randomized design, inclusion of a pediatric population, 100% completion rate, and masking of participants to the specific aims of the study. Additional strengths include the control for treatment intensity, a well-differentiated message about water consumption with the same background standardized weight-reducing intervention, and use of various behavioral supports to maximize differentiation and adherence. In addition to the suboptimal adherence to the 8 \u00d7 8 recommendation as discussed above, other study limitations include the small sample size and reliance on self-report for dietary assessment, recognizing the well-documented potential for recall and social desirability biases.",
