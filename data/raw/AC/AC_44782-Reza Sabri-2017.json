At present, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil have been used to control pulmonary pressure before and after cardiac surgery. Recently, tadalafil has been utilised in older children with similar efficacy, but it has been used to a lesser extent in young infants. From April, 2015 to June, 2016, 42 patients aged 3-24 months with a large septal defect and pulmonary arterial hypertension were randomly divided into two equal groups: one group received oral sildenafil (1-3 mg/kg/day every 8 hours), whereas the other group received oral tadalafil (1 mg/kg once a day) from 7-10 days before surgery to 3-4 weeks after surgery. During the first 48 hours after surgery, pulmonary artery-to-aortic pressure ratio and recorded systolic pulmonary artery pressures were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05); moreover, there were no differences in paediatric ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation time, clinical findings of low cardiac output state, and echocardiographic data between the two groups (p > 0.05). Most of the patients had no side effects, and only five patients had a minor with no significant difference in both groups (p = 0.371). Tadalafil can be considered as an effective oral therapy for preoperative and postoperative pulmonary hypertension in young infants. It can be administered at a once-daily dose with an appropriate efficacy and safety profile as sildenafil, and therefore it can be considered as an alternative to sildenafil in young children.",

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of pulmonary hypertension distinguished haemodynamically by the presence of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension, which includes an end-expiratory pulmonary artery wedge pressure \u2a7d 15 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance more than 3 Wood units. 1, 2 In addition, these patients might develop postoperative pulmonary hypertensive crisis. The pulmonary hypertensive crisis is a dangerous state of severe rise in pulmonary arterial pressure usually with bronchospasm, often followed within seconds with a profound reduction in cardiac output and reduction in O 2 saturation. This has been commonly observed in neonates and infants who are intubated for surgery for a CHD associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 3 Despite intensive therapy, these crises may be fatal and prevention is critically important. Ventilation with 100% oxygen, hyperventilation, neuromuscular blockade, deep sedation, use of inhaled nitric oxide, as a selective pulmonary vasodilator, and alternatively inhaled prostacyclin and milrinone alone or combined together show improved cardiac function, minimise the incidence of pulmonary hypertensive crisis, and lower the risk of morbidity and mortality. 3, 4 Selective phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, administered intravenously or orally, have been shown to be effective and safe in weaning patients from inhaled nitric oxide easily and to control the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) both before and after cardiac surgery in children. [1] [2] [3] 5 Tadalafil is another phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, which has been recently considered for this purpose in adults. The drug obtained US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2009, but studies in young children regarding tadalafil are lacking. 4 Tadalafil is usually administered once a day and has a longer half-life (17 hours) than sildenafil (4 hours). A few studies have shown that tadalafil can be used safely in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension and may prevent the progression of the disease and may also have more efficacy and safety than sildenafil. 6, 7 Although the FDA has warned against prescribing sildenafil for children with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the European Medicines Agency recommends its use in children.
