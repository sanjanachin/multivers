OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether neonatal caffeine therapy is associated with improved functional outcomes 11 years later. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A follow-up study was conducted at 14 academic hospitals in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom from May 7, 2011, to May 27, 2016, of English-or French-speaking children who had been enrolled in the randomized, placebo-controlled Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial between October 11, 1999, and October 22, 2004. A total of 1202 children with birth weights of 500 to 1250 g were eligible for this study; 920 (76.5%) had adequate data for the main outcome. INTERVENTIONS Caffeine citrate or placebo until drug therapy for apnea of prematurity was no longer needed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Functional impairment was a composite of poor academic performance (defined as at least 1 standard score greater than 2 SD below the mean on the Wide Range Achievement Test-4), motor impairment (defined as a percentile rank of \u05455 on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition), and behavior problems (defined as a Total Problem T score \u05462 SD above the mean on the Child Behavior Checklist). RESULTS Among the 920 children (444 females and 476 males; median age, 11.4 years [interquartile range, 11.1-11.8 years]), the combined rates of functional impairment were not significantly different between the 457 children assigned to receive caffeine compared with the 463 children assigned to receive placebo (145 [31.7%] vs 174 [37.6%]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59-1.02; P = .07). With all available data, including those from up to 24 Swedish trial participants, the rates of poor academic performance on 1 or more of 4 subtests (66 of 458 [14.4%] vs 61 of 462 [13.2%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.77-1.61; P = .58) and behavior problems (52 of 476 [10.9%] vs 40 of 481 [8.3%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.85-2.07; P = .22) were broadly similar between the group that received caffeine and the group that received placebo. However, caffeine therapy was associated with a reduced risk of motor impairment compared with placebo (90 of 457 [19.7%] vs 130 of 473 [27.5%]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.90; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity did not significantly reduce the combined rate of academic, motor, and behavioral impairments but was associated with a reduced risk of motor impairment in 11-year-old children with very low birth weight. At the doses used in this trial, neonatal caffeine therapy is effective and safe into middle school age.",
