Methods Thirty-six obese girls (age: 10.4 \u00b1 0.9 years, body mass: 58.7 \u00b1 4.0 kg, height: 1.37 \u00b1 0.04 m, body mass index: 31.2 \u00b1 2.1) participated in three weekly physical exercise sessions for 6 weeks, with each session consisting of basic fundamental locomotor movements. The participants were divided into two groups: a control group (CG) and an experimental group (EG). CG performed the exercise in a quiet setting (i.e., without rhythmic accompaniment), whereas regular and irregular rhythmic accompaniments were prescribed in EG. The physical exercise programme included three sessions per week for 6 weeks. Each session was composed of three parts: 15 min of warm-up, followed by 40 min of exercises based on basic locomotor movements (i.e., running, hopping, skipping, jumping, leaping, sliding, galloping, throwing, catching, kicking, dribbling, and striking) and then obese children demonstrate significantly lower levels of motor coordination than their normal-weight peers [7, 8] . Therefore, initiating programmes that target MS enhancement at an early age seems to be of great importance, especially for obese girls, this helps, of course, to prevent from obesity complications. In this context, other different methods have, indeed, been used.",

Each MS was assessed according to this scale: excellent: 5, good: 4, average: 3, poor: 2, and very poor: 1. These scores were obtained in relation to the tempo imposed during the exercise and which was ascendant (very slow to fastest tempo).

This suggests that a programme including rhythmic exercise improves cardiovascular function in obese girls. This is important, since RPP is an indicator of myocardial oxygen consumption, and it may be help to evaluate ventricular function [24] . Our results let us suggest that the progression of rhythmic ability following regular and irregular rhythm exercises in the EG led to an improvement of motor coordination and has regulated the timing of the sequence of muscle contractions that produce movement as reported by Thaut [25] , which has resulted in a better physical fitness condition after the training programme.",

Indeed, some auditory rhythms can generate an emotional response, which may be motivating (compared with a neutral stimulus). This has been supported by Coombes et al. [27] . The authors have concluded that MS efficiency increases when the stimulus evokes this type of emotional response. Thus, the tempos used in the present study may have been appreciated by the obese girls, permitting an improvement of their MS. In fact, using an auditory rhythm (e.g., a metronome) when exercising could be an effective way to improve MS. Thus, knowing how to incorporate an auditory rhythm into exercise for children may help to improve the rhythmic and technical skills of the young in the fastest and most efficient way possible. As noted by Repp and Penel [28] , auditory rhythms are more familiar to most individuals as they can be readily perceived. In this context, the accompaniment of rhythmic instruments in the present study may have affected participants' motivation, more than the exercise itself. Some limitations in this research design should nevertheless be noted. Although boys seem to spend more time in physical education and seem to be more engaged in physical activity than girls, some researchers [29, 30] have pointed out that girls perform better than boys in rhythmic ability. To avoid the confounding effects of sex on the results, we opted in the current study to focus only on obese school girls. Thus, the present results have to be interpreted only for this population. However, these findings need to be replicated in more diverse samples (i.e., in boys and girls over a wider age range) using different contexts (e.g., play in collective games or holding different objects to mark rhythm, etc.) in which children engage in physical exercise.",
