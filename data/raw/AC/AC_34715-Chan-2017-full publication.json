        "text": "Background: To investigate the performance and patient acceptability of an inhaler electronic monitoring device in a real-world childhood asthma population. Methods: Children 6 to 15 years presenting with asthma to the hospital emergency department and prescribed inhaled corticosteroids were included. Participants were randomized to receive a device with reminder features enabled or disabled for use with their preventer. Device quality control tests were conducted. Questionnaires on device acceptability, utility and ergonomics were completed at six months. Results: A total of 1306 quality control tests were conducted; 84% passed pre-issue and 87% return testing. The most common failure reason was actuation under-recording. Acceptability scores were high, with higher scores in the reminder than non-reminder group (median, 5 th-95 th percentile: 4.1, 3.1-5.0 versus 3.7, 2.3-4.8; p < 0.001). Most (>90%) rated the device easy to use. Feedback was positive across five themes: device acceptability, ringtone acceptability, suggestions for improvement, effect on medication use, and effect on asthma control. Conclusions: This study investigates electronic monitoring device performance and acceptability in children using quantitative and qualitative measures. Results indicate satisfactory reliability, although failure rates of 13-16% indicate the importance of quality control. Favorable acceptability ratings support the use of these devices in children.",

In the present study, we created a 7-item acceptability questionnaire which explored a variety of criteria, including attitudes to device use in public, responses to device features, and ergonomic factors such as size and ease of handling. The questionnaire was designed such that it can be administered relatively quickly and easily to children. Whilst this questionnaire was designed for the SmartTrack EMD and was answered by children, we specifically included questions generalizable to other EMDs and other age groups [14] such as assessing satisfaction with continued use, effects on medication management and attitudes to use in public ( Table 3 ). The ratings in the questionnaire were skewed, as is common to satisfaction rating scales [30] [31] [32] , and while distributional skew did not prevent the finding of statistical differences between the reminder and non-reminder groups, the magnitude of the difference between groups may have been underestimated. Further, like the questionnaires used in the small acceptability studies carried out previously in adults and adolescents [11, 12] , our acceptability questionnaire was not validated. Young children can have difficulty comprehending the language used in questionnaires, and older children may refuse to complete questionnaires or provide inaccurate answers [33] . Although we report a high questionnaire completion rate (>95%), we cannot be certain that the questionnaire responses of younger children were not influenced by comprehension difficulties, though researchers assisted with comprehension where appropriate. Further validation testing of our questionnaire is recommended in a future acceptability study in children.",

Device performance was consistent with that of other EMDs, though there remains a small but important failure rate which needs to be addressed prior to use in a clinical setting. This study reinforces the practical approach and resources needed for QC testing and its key role for enhancing the integrity of adherence data. Using a combination of quantitative and open-text qualitative methods to explore patient acceptability, we found that the SmartTrack EMD was highly acceptable, highlighting the feasibility of its use in children. EMD use also positively affected attitudes toward adherence and perceptions of asthma control. Further research combining EMD reliability and acceptability assessments, including the influence of EMD use on perceptions of disease control, is recommended to ensure a wide and successful uptake of EMDs in research and clinical settings, and to increase our understanding of the role of EMDs in adherence interventions.",
