        "text": "BACKGROUND: Most interventions designed to reduce teen pregnancy rates have not focused on pregnant and/or parenting adolescents. Therefore, a large randomized controlled trial was conducted regarding a motivational interviewing program entitled Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy in a low-income sample of adolescent mothers. This program recommended monthly sessions between a participant and a registered nurse over 18 months. This program also featured facilitated birth control access through transportation assistance and a part-time contraceptive clinic. OBJECTIVE: The impact of this program on rapid repeat pregnancies at 18 months after enrollment was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: Five hundred ninety-eight adolescent females were enrolled from 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics and 5 postpartum units of a large hospital system in a Midwestern city. Each participant was enrolled at least 28 weeks pregnant or less than 9 weeks postpartum. Each participant was randomized to either the Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy intervention or a usual-care control condition. Intervention participants averaged 4.5 hours of assistance. Participants were contacted by blinded research staff at 6 and 18 months to complete self-report surveys. Differences in outcomes between the intervention and control groups were assessed using ordinary leastsquares regression. RESULTS: There was an 18.1% absolute reduction in self-reported repeat pregnancy in the intervention group relative to the control group (20.5% vs 38.6%%; P < .001). There was a 13.7% absolute increase in self-reported long-acting reversible contraception use in the intervention group relative to the control group (40.2% vs 26.5%, P \u00bc .002). There was no evidence of harmful effects of the intervention on sexual risk behaviors, such as having sexual intercourse without a condom or greater number of partners. CONCLUSION: The Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy program represents one of the few evidence-based interventions to reduce rapid repeat teen pregnancy. This relatively brief intervention may be a viable alternative to more time-intensive programs that adolescent mothers may be unable or unwilling to receive.",

        "text": "Therefore, Goesling et al 6 recently reviewed nonehome visitation programs designed to reduce teen pregnancy. Of 31 interventions with moderate or high evidence of effectiveness in any sexual health domain, only 5 had specific empirical support for reducing adolescent pregnancies and/or births. None concentrated on reducing rapid repeat teen pregnancy; all 5 featured predominantly or exclusively nulliparous adolescents. In fact, just 2 of the overall 31 interventions focused on parenting teens, and the impact of these programs on repeat pregnancies or births was not assessed. 7, 8 Motivational interviewing (MI) represents a promising approach for reducing rapid repeat teen pregnancy. MI is a nonconfrontational and collaborative communication style designed to promote behavior change. MI focuses on identifying a participant's own intrinsic motivation as opposed to highlighting reasons for change from someone else's perspective. 9 Over a relatively brief number of sessions, MI features a clinician eliciting an adolescent's own reasons for engaging in a particular health behavior (eg, effective contraceptive use). 9 A recent meta-analysis indicated that MI has considerable scientific support for various adolescent health concerns. 10 However, MI has rarely been studied specifically for teen pregnancy prevention. MI was not featured in any of the 5 empirically supported adolescent pregnancy prevention programs identified from the previously mentioned review of Goesling et al. 6 Two studies demonstrated that MI increased condom use in college students, 11, 12 while two other studies showed that MI decreased ineffective contraceptive use in older women. 13, 14 However, these 4 investigations neither included participants who were currently pregnant nor assessed subsequent pregnancies. Barnet et al 15 completed a small randomized trial of MI to reduce rapid repeat pregnancy in adolescent mothers. Using a 3 arm design featuring a total of 235 pregnant teenagers aged 18 years and older, they tested a paraprofessional-delivered form of MI. Fifty-three percent of adolescents in the intervention conditions were deemed adherent (ie, completed at least 2 sessions of MI).",

        "text": "Our principal finding was the 18.1% absolute reduction in self-reported repeat pregnancy in the TOPP intervention group relative to the UC control group (20.5% vs 38.6%) at 18 months. Similarly, TOPP led to an 11.6% absolute reduction in repeat births according to birth certificate files (23.9% vs 35.5%) at 30 months. The consistency of the significant differences across 2 diverse data sources increases confidence in the conclusion that TOPP-produced reductions in rapid repeat pregnancy rates. Furthermore, the beneficial outcomes were achieved through an intervention that lasted on average 4.5 hours, which is Means and differences are regression adjusted to account for differences across groups in age, race, random assignment strata, and a baseline measure of the outcome (if available) or proxy for the baseline measure. Effective birth refers to using any of the following methods: condoms, birth control pills, the shot, the patch, the ring, intrauterine device, and implants. Unprotected vaginal intercourse refers to having vaginal intercourse without using any of the following methods: condoms, birth control pills, the shot, the patch, the ring, intrauterine device, and implants. Noteworthy strengths of this randomized trial included the following: (1) large sample sizes; (2) groups that did not differ on nearly all baseline characteristics prior to randomization; (3) use of independent evaluators; (4) intent-totreat analyses; (5) low survey attrition rates; (6) moderate fidelity ratings for the motivational interviewing component; and (7) few eligibility restrictions. Regarding the latter, the highly regarded Contraceptive CHOICE project limited its sample to adolescents interested in switching contraceptive methods or not using contraception at all. 21 In contrast, results of the present study may be more generalizable because our participants were eligible regardless of their contraceptive attitudes or behaviors. This difference in eligibility criteria may help explain why the Contraceptive CHOICE project had higher LARC utilization rates (72%) than were achieved in the TOPP intervention group (40%).",
