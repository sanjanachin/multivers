Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 34 Class II division 1 malocclusion subjects at or just before the peak phase of pubertal growth as assessed by hand-wrist radiographs. Subjects were assigned to two groups of mandibular advancement, using matched randomization. Both groups were treated with the FMA. While the mandible was advanced to a super Class I molar relation in the single-step advancement group (SSG), patients in the stepwise mandibular advancement group (SWG) had a 4-mm initial bite advancement and subsequent 2-mm advancements at bimonthly intervals. The material consisted of lateral cephalograms taken before treatment and after 10 months of FMA treatment. Data were analyzed by means paired t-tests and an independent t-test. Results: There were statistically significant changes in SNB, Pg horizontal, ANB, Co-Gn, and Co-Go measurements in both groups (P , .001); these changes were greater in the SWG with the exception of Co-Go (P , .05). While significant differences were found in U1-SN, IMPA, L6 horizontal, overjet, and overbite appraisals in each group (P , .001), these changes were comparable (P. .05). Conclusion: Because of the higher rates of sagittal mandibular skeletal changes, FMA using stepwise advancement of the mandible might be the appliance of choice for treating Class II division 1 malocclusions.",

        "text": "In the literature, treatment effects of gradual advancement of functional appliances compared with single maximal protrusion have been discussed with conflicting results. The variability of reported results can be ascribed to the different protocols of stepwise advancement, types of appliances used, and patients' maturational levels at the time of intervention. Additionally, in a fraction of the studies, methodological bias was introduced since comparison of stepwise and single-step activation was made in the treatment groups using nonidentical functional appliances. 7, 8, 11, 12 In only one study were two modes of activation compared, each using an identical fixed functional Herbst appliance, 16 although it was conducted on adult patients. In the present study, we aimed to maximize the robustness of the method of comparing the two advancement modes by enrolling subjects in their peak phase of pubertal growth. It should be noted that the dentoskeletal effects of the two modes of mandibular advancement with the FMA were based on the cumulative effects of physiologic growth and treatment-induced effects. Since the aim of this study was to compare two modes of protrusive activations in treating a Class II division 1 malocclusion using the same appliance for both groups, a control group of untreated Class II subjects was not formed. The other important reason for this decision was the ethical concern of leaving patients untreated during their pubertal growth spurt. Reviewing the literature, we found that the amount of initial advancement and intervals of subsequent advancement notably differ among studies. In headgear-Herbst studies, the mandible was advanced initially 2 mm and thereafter an additional 2 mm at bimonthly intervals. 8, 11 In activator-headgear treatment groups, 4 mm of sagittal advancement was carried out every 3 months. 8, 15 Patients treated with the Twin-block had a 2-mm advancement at 6-week intervals. 14 In treatment with the Bass appliance, the mandible was advanced initially half a cusp forward from the intercuspal position, with thereafter small protrusive activations (2 mm) at short intervals of 6 weeks. 7 In adult samples treated with the Herbst, the patients had an initial advancement of at least 4 mm with a 6-month duration for each advancement. 12, 16 In particular, rat studies revealed that the amount of initial advancement is important. 9, 23 Rabie and Al-Kalaly 23 demonstrated that a 4-mm advancement resulted in a significantly greater increase in type II collagen (the major component of condylar cartilage) and in total amount of new bone formation on the condyle compared with a 2-mm advancement group. The investigators stressed that a minimal threshold of strain must be exceeded to promote an ideal response. 9, 23 Thus, the authors of the current study preferred an initial advancement of 4 mm, which could subject the condylar tissue to greater mechanical strain. Subsequent advancements were set at 2 mm every 2 months to repeatedly maximize the number of replicating cells in the condyle and glenoid fossa. 24, 25 The duration of mandibular advancement is another important aspect. In the rat study, premature removal of the functional appliance has been shown to cause subnormal growth at the condyle during the immediate posttreatment period, compared with the control group. 26 Keeping the mandible in a forward position for a longer period of time (ie, at least 10 months) has been advocated to convert newly formed bone matrix into more stable type I collagen matrix and to secure normal levels of mandibular growth following removal of the functional appliance. 26 In this respect, we made sure that the FMA was kept in situ for 10 months.",

Although the magnitude of differences between the two groups could be perceived as not clinically significant, it should not be overlooked that the statistically significant difference between groups suggests that the stepwise advancement is more appropriate for increasing the skeletal effect. In partial agreement with the our results in a stepwise group of adult patients, the change in sagittal position of the mandible was somewhat larger but nonsignificant, and improvement only in jaw base relationship (ANB, Wits, and NAPg measurements) was significantly greater in the stepwise group than in the single-step group. 16 This difference between the present and aforementioned study 16 was probably related to patient age. On the other hand, studies using identical removable functional appliances in stepwise vs single, large-advancement groups indicated that there was no difference in obtained mandibular orthopedic effects between the two groups. [13] [14] [15] In both groups of the current study, palatal tipping of the maxillary incisors, protrusion of the mandibular incisors, and mesial movement and mesial tipping of the mandibular molars were observed, similar to other FMA 5 and MARA studies. 19, 29 Distal movement of the maxillary molars that was reported in a previous FMA study 5 was not seen in the present study, which could be attributed to the palatal arch integrated into the stainless steel crowns on the molars. The dental changes mentioned above were similar for both SWG and SSG. Although a trend indicating less protrusion of the mandibular incisors in the SWG was evident, it did not reach significance (P \u00bc .060). This finding is in agreement with previous studies reporting no difference between stepwise and single-step groups, but contradicts the headgear-activator study in which the mandibular incisors were unaffected in the stepwise advancement group. 15 ",
