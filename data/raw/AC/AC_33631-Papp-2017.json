        "text": "Background Adalimumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in adults. We assessed the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in children and adolescents with severe plaque psoriasis. Methods This randomised, double-blind, multiperiod, phase 3 trial was done at 38 clinics in 13 countries. Patients (aged \u22654 to <18 years) with severe plaque psoriasis who had not responded to topical therapy were randomly assigned with an interactive voice or web-response system (1:1:1) to receive adalimumab 0\u20228 mg/kg or 0\u20224 mg/kg subcutaneously at week 0, then every other week starting at week 1, or oral methotrexate once weekly (0\u20221-0\u20224 mg/kg) for 16 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by history of etanercept treatment, with a block size of three. Responders were withdrawn from treatment (for up to 36 weeks) and retreated with adalimumab (for 16 weeks) if disease became uncontrolled. Ranked primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved at least 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) score and clear or minimal physician global assessment (PGA) score at week 16, comparing adalimumab 0\u20228 mg/kg with methotrexate. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat, and safety analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01251614, and has been completed. Findings Between Dec 14, 2010, and Feb 5, 2015, 114 patients were randomly assigned to adalimumab 0\u20228 mg/kg (n=38), adalimumab 0\u20224 mg/kg (n=39) or methotrexate (n=37). At week 16, PASI75 was achieved in 22 (58%) of 38 patients in the adalimumab 0\u20228 mg/kg group compared with 12 (32%) of 37 patients in the methotrexate group (p=0\u2022027). 23 (61%) of 38 patients in the adalimumab 0\u20228 mg/kg group and 15 (41%) of 37 in the methotrexate group achieved clear or minimal PGA (p=0\u2022083). In the adalimumab 0\u20224 mg/kg group, 17 (44%) of 39 patients achieved PASI75 and 16 (41%) achieved clear or minimal PGA. The most frequent adverse events were infections (17 [45%] of 38 in the adalimumab 0\u20228 mg/kg group during initial treatment; 22 [56%] of 39 in the adalimumab 0\u20224 mg/kg group; 21 [57%] of 37 in the methotrexate group). Three serious adverse events were reported, all in patients in the adalimumab 0\u20224 mg/kg group, and were not judged to be related to study drug. Interpretation Treatment with adalimumab 0\u20228 mg/kg in children and adolescents with severe plaque psoriasis provided significant improvements in PASI75 and a non-significant increase in the proportion of patients who achieved clear or minimal PGA compared with methotrexate. No new safety risks were identified.",

A similar PASI75 response at week 16 (36%) for methotrexate was reported in a randomised controlled trial of adalimumab and methotrexate in adult patients with psoriasis. 17 No biologics are approved in the USA for paediatric psoriasis, although adalimumab 18 17, [21] [22] [23] The relative efficacy of adalimumab and methotrexate in children with psoriasis must be balanced with the safety profiles of the two treatments. Few studies have characterised the long-term safety of treatment for psoriasis in children. Because of extensive experience with its use, methotrexate has accumulated a larger body of safety evidence than adalimumab. Methotrexate treatment in children with psoriasis is associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects, fatigue, and abnormal liver function tests, as well as less common but more serious events. 24 Because methotrexate treatment was restricted to the first 16 weeks of our study, subsequent safety comparisons versus adalimumab are tenuous. 24 Results from longer studies in adults with psoriasis or children with other disorders can be cautiously extrapolated, keeping in mind that the safety profiles might vary between the different populations. In a large, long-term registry study in 2263 young patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (mean age 11\u20223 years; mean treatment exposure 5\u20225 years), adalimumab was associated with significantly higher risks of serious adverse events than methotrexate (8% judged to be possibly related to treatment) and infections, but not medically important infections, cancer, or deaths. 25 Safety results from a randomised study in adults with psoriasis showed similar adverse events for adalimumab and methotrexate (74% and 81%, respectively); 17 frequencies that are similar to those in our study (73% and 76%).

Although the study did not include a placebo group because of ethical issues related to treatment of paediatric patients with a severe, chronic disorder, 26 it directly assessed adalimumab versus an active comparator. A limitation of this study is that there are no controlled methotrexate studies to compare with our population. Although it has been argued that maximum therapeutic effects of methotrexate can take 4-6 months to become apparent, 27 near-maximal results (with little further improvement) were achieved for methotrexate by week 16 in a 52-week study in which the comparator was briakinumab; 28 16 weeks of therapy were assessed in our study.",

Responses were lost following treatment withdrawal, but largely recovered during re-treatment with adalimumab. The safety profile of adalimumab was similar to that for methotrexate; no new safety risks were identified. Our findings suggest that adalimumab is a safe and efficacious treatment option for severe paediatric plaque psoriasis.",
