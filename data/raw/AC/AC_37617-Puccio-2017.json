Methods: Healthy infants, 0 to 14 days old, were randomized to an intactprotein, cow's milk-based infant formula (control, n \u00bc 87) or the same formula with 1.0 g/L 2 0 fucosyllactose (2 0 FL) and 0.5 g/L lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) (test, n \u00bc 88) from enrollment to 6 months; all infants received standard follow-up formula without HMOs from 6 to 12 months. Primary endpoint was weight gain through 4 months. Secondary endpoints included additional anthropometric measures, gastrointestinal tolerance, behavioral patterns, and morbidity through age 12 months. Results: Weight gain was similar in both groups (mean difference [95% confidence interval] test vs control: \u00c00.30 [\u00c01.94, 1.34] g/day; lower bound of 95% confidence interval was above noninferiority margin [\u00c03 g/day]). Digestive symptoms and behavioral patterns were similar between groups; exceptions included softer stool (P \u00bc 0.021) and fewer nighttime wake-ups (P \u00bc 0.036) in the test group at 2 months. Infants receiving test (vs control) had significantly fewer parental reports (P \u00bc 0.004-0.047) of bronchitis through 4 (2.3% vs 12.6%), 6 (6.8% vs 21.8%), and 12 months (10.2% vs 27.6%); lower respiratory tract infection (adverse event cluster) through 12 months (19.3% vs 34.5%); antipyretics use through 4 months (15.9% vs 29.9%); and antibiotics use through 6 (34.1% vs 49.4%) and 12 months (42.0% vs 60.9%). Conclusions: Infant formula with 2 0 FL and LNnT is safe, well-tolerated, and supports age-appropriate growth. Secondary outcome findings showing associations between consuming HMO-supplemented formula and lower parent-reported morbidity (particularly bronchitis) and medication use (antipyretics and antibiotics) warrant confirmation in future studies.",

Importantly, we observed lower rates of respiratory tract-related morbidity outcomes among infants fed formula with 2 0 FL and LNnT compared with those fed the control formula. We also observed a lower likelihood of reporting the use of antipyretic and antibiotic medications in the test group. Although these secondary outcome findings showing associations between HMOsupplemented formula and lower parent-reported morbidity and medication use warrant confirmation in future studies, accumulating evidence (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) showing both local anti-adhesion and systemic immunomodulatory effects of HMOs provides mechanistic support for an effect on respiratory tract-related morbidities. Specifically, HMOs rinse the laryngopharyngeal region during oral consumption and could potentially reduce pathogen adhesion locally at the entrance to the upper respiratory tract (41). 2 0 FL was shown to inhibit the binding of pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa to respiratory cells (36) . LNnT was shown to reduce pneumococcal load in rabbit lungs when instilled concurrently with or 24 hours after Streptococcus pneumonia challenge and altered the progression of pre-existing pneumonia by preventing bacterial adherence (37) . Prior incubation with LNnT also prevented adherence of S. pneumonia to chinchilla lungs (38) . In addition to this, HMOs may play a systemic immunomodulatory role via direct mediation of cell-cell interactions in the immune system (41) when HMOs are absorbed intact into the circulation (26, 28, 42) , and modulation of gut microbiota with indirect downstream effects on the immune system when largely indigestible HMOs reach the infant's colon (43) . Duska-McEwen et al (40) recently reported that 2 0 FL and LNnT may decrease viral load in an in vitro model by enhancing innate immune responses to respiratory syncytial virus NM232 and influenza A virus H1N1 (NC99), 2 viruses associated with lower respiratory infections.",

In addition, infants were followed until 1 year of age, which allowed us to capture the potential sustained effects of HMOs consumed during the first 6 months of age. A limitation of the study is the absence of growth and secondary outcome data from a breast-fed reference group. In addition to this, GI tolerance data were based on parent report, which may be susceptible to under-or overeporting, although instructions from study staff on how to complete the diary, use of common terms for GI symptoms in the diary, and the double-blind study design reduced the risk that parents in the test group systematically differed from the control group in under-or overreporting these outcomes. The use of morbidity assessments based on parent-reported symptoms/illnesses and medication use, rather than a direct evaluation and diagnosis of each suspected illness by the study physician, is also a potential limitation. Although we were not able to implement the latter approach in this trial due to an increased burden on study participants and sites, any illness-related information reported by the parent was carefully reviewed and verified by study physicians at each clinic visit, and AEs of interest were well defined and identified a priori. Nonetheless, additional studies are needed to confirm whether HMOsupplemented infant formulas confer protection from illness. If replicated, the effects of HMOs on morbidity and medication use will carry substantial positive implications for the health of infants.
