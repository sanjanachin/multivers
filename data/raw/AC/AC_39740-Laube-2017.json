In animal models of BPD, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been shown to reduce lung inflammation, but data for human preterm infants is missing. Methods Within a European multicenter trial of NO inhalation for preterm infants to prevent BPD (EUNO), TA was collected to determine the effects of iNO on pulmonary inflammation. TA was collected from 43 premature infants randomly assigned to receive either iNO or placebo gas (birth weight 530-1230 g, median 800 g, gestational age 24 to 28 2/7 weeks, median 26 weeks). Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 1 , interferon \u03b3induced protein 10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), neuropeptide Y and leukotriene B 4 were measured in serial TA samples from postnatal day 2 to 14. Furthermore, TA levels of nitrotyrosine and nitrite were determined under iNO therapy. Results The TA levels of IP-10, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, ASM and albumin increased with advancing postnatal age in critically ill preterm infants, whereas nitrotyrosine TA levels declined in both, iNO-treated and placebo-treated infants. The iNO treatment generally increased nitrite TA levels, whereas nitrotyrosine TA levels were not affected by iNO treatment.

First, the downstream target of IFN-\u03b3, the chemokine IP-10 showed increasing TA concentrations during the study period in both groups, yet iNO treatment significantly reduced IP-10 levels at PD2, compared to the placebo-treated group. In a study of ventilated preterm infants, the IFN-\u03b3 and IP-10 TA levels were higher within the first 48 h of life in infants that developed BPD or died [80, 81] , suggesting that increases in IFN-\u03b3 and IP-10 levels precede neutrophil infiltration and could therefore represent critical early response molecules in the development of BPD [82] , similar to what has been suggested for ARDS [22] . Thus, the early reduction of IP-10 levels by iNO might indicate a diminished inflammatory status in those infants that might be accompanied by a reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung. This is supported by an experimental BPD model of mechanically ventilated premature lambs in which low-dose iNO (5 ppm) decreased early lung neutrophil recruitment and accumulation [33] . However, the effect of iNO on IP-10 levels was transient. In addition, increased IL-8 TA levels have been described on PD1 and PD3 in preterm infants who subsequently developed BPD, preceding the neutrophil infiltration [83] [84] [85] ; however, elevated TA IL-8 levels also seem to be associated with BPD development in older infants [13, 86] . Here we found a rise of IL-8 TA concentrations during the study period and iNO treatment significantly reduced IL-8 TA levels at PD2. Since early IL-8 TA elevations supposedly precede neutrophil infiltrations in BPD risk infants [83] , an early reduction induced by iNO might reduce neutrophil recruitment to the lung. In agreement with our results, iNO treatment has been shown to reduce BAL IL-8 concentrations and neutrophil infiltration in a pig model of lung injury [87] and human patients with ARDS [88] . Similar to IP-10, the effect of iNO on IL-8 levels was transient. The reason for this observation is currently unknown, but decreasing NO absorption or an elevated first-pass effect seems unlikely, since nitrite TA levels were relatively stable over the study period. Because infants are extubated as soon as possible, thus limiting TA sampling, a selection towards the more serious cases or patients in which iNO treatment failed to improve inflammatory mediator levels possibly contributes to the early transient effects of iNO. Another possible reason for the transient effect of iNO might be due to the development of tolerance to the clinical and physiological effects of NO upon continuous administration [89] . The mechanism of tolerance to NO donors has been thoroughly investigated, especially in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, but remains mainly elusive and highly debated. Notably, tolerance to nitrovasodilators generally begins to develop within 24 to 48 h of continuous application [89] , and could thus be an explanation for the early transient effects of iNO observed in our study. Next-generation NO donors with improved pharmacokinetic properties might be able to prolong the anti-inflammatory effects of NO treatment in critically ill preterm infants.",

Furthermore, iNO treatment strongly increased nitrite TA levels throughout the study period. Besides, a delayed increase of ASM TA levels induced by iNO was detected. A beneficial effect of iNO was demonstrated on early inflammatory/fibrotic markers including TGF-\u03b2 1 , IP-10 and IL-8. Whether the demonstrated reduction of early inflammatory mediators possibly improves long-term lung function has to be determined in follow-up studies, since BPD incidence was not affected by iNO treatment in the EUNO trial [45] .
