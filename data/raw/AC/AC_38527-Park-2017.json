Twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to the probiotics group and 29 to the placebo group. The probiotics group was fed a probiotic formula containing B. longum BORI and L. acidophilus AD031. There were no differences in the age, sex, or blood characteristics of the two groups. The experimental outcomes are summarized in Table 1 . The probiotics group showed a slightly reduced duration of fever (p = 0.119), frequency of diarrhea (p = 0.119), and frequency of vomiting (p = 0.331) compared to the placebo group; however, these differences were not significant. By contrast, the duration of diarrhea during the three-day treatment showed a significant difference between the probiotics group (4.38 \u00b1 1.29) and the placebo group (5.61 \u00b1 1.23) with a p-value of 0.001 (Table 1 ). There were no serious, adverse events and no difference in the frequency of adverse events in both groups. The probiotic formula containing B. longum BORI and L. acidophilus AD031 utilized in this work is likely be an effective adjuvant to relieve acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus. Several studies showed that various strains of probiotic bacteria, such as L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus, were effective in managing acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus in toddlers. In the present experiment, the efficacy of B. longum BORI and L. acidophilus AD031 probiotic products was tested. Our rationale for the L. acidophilus and B. longum combination was based on the general microbial composition, which shows a predominance of Lactobacillus sp. in the small intestine and Bifidobacterium sp. in the large intestine (among a variety of beneficial bacteria present in healthy human subjects). Eighteen of 23 clinical trials of probiotic formulas resulted in mitigating acute diarrhea, and the reduction of the duration of diarrhea in the studies' probiotics treatment group was reported to be 0.5 to 1.5 days [16] . The duration of diarrhea may vary depending on a child's health status, diet, and prescribed medication. Our study demonstrated a statistically significant diarrhea reduction of 1.2 days. The efficacy of probiotics is strain-specific, so this may be due to the use of different strains in different studies. Basu et al. [17] conducted a clinical study with 10 7 CFU/day LGG and concluded that it was not effective, but when they performed the same study again [18] with 10 10 and 10 12 CFU/day LGG, they concluded that a higher concentration of LGG administration in acute diarrhea patients was effective in reducing the diarrhea frequency, diarrhea period, and hospitalization period. Fang et al. [19] reported a dose-dependent effect of Lb. rhamnosus on fecal rotavirus concentration and suggested 6 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/day as the minimal effective dose, which was similar to the data of Guanidalin [20] , who concluded that at least 10 billion cells/day was necessary. Dubay [21] also applied the commercially available probiotic formula (VSL#3, CD Pharma India, New Delhi, India) to mitigate acute diarrhea, which showed a more rapid recovery compared to the control group and decreased the necessity of electrolyte treatments. In contrast to the positive results mentioned above, a probiotic formula containing 10 9 CFU/day of B. lactis and 10 8 CFU/day of S. thermophilus failed to decrease the duration of rotavirus diarrhea [22] . These contrasting results suggest that further clinical experiments are necessary in order to understand the scientific basis of the efficacy of probiotics and its relation to a number of criteria the strain of probiotics, the type of rotavirus, the severity of the symptoms, the ages and races of the children, etc. Further study using animal models also should be considered since the experimental conditions in this model can be better controlled [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",
