A prior pilot study on the universal application of Coping Power showed a significant decrease in the hyperactivity behaviors of five classes. The next step was to test whether Coping Power Universal could be successfully implemented by teachers in a variety of Italian schools. The sample involved 40 third-and fourth-grade classes (901 students) from public schools located in three Italian cities. Twenty classes were randomly assigned to Coping Power Universal, and 20 classes were randomly assigned to the control group, which received the strictly standard academic curriculum of Italian elementary schools. At each assessment period, the teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The findings showed a significant reduction in hyperactive and inattention behaviors and conduct problems and emotional symptoms in the intervention classes compared with the control classes. This study suggests that Coping Power model can be delivered in school settings at both universal and targeted prevention levels and that in this multi-tiered prevention model, teachers can learn a set of intervention skills which can be delivered with flexibility, thus reducing some of the complexity and costs of schools using multiple interventions.",

In addition, these behaviors in the elementary years predict later academic underachievement, need for special education, and increased likelihood of school dropout (Masten et al. 2010) , and it could be hypothesized that the severity of behavioral problems might be an important and unique predictor of all forms of school maladjustment, through both direct and indirect processes (Dodge et al. 2008) . Behavioral problems among schoolchildren are an international problem, and are apparent in Italy, the site of this trial. Forty-two percent of children in primary schools and 28 % in secondary schools have indicated that they had been the victims by peer aggression at least a few times in the previous 3-month period (Genta et al. 1996) . Finally, it has been recognized for many years that schools are optimal environments for interventions because of the amount of time children spend in school. For these reasons, we adapted Coping Power (CP) as a universal prevention model aimed to reduce children's behavioral difficulties in Italian primary schools. This new model of intervention, named Coping Power Universal (CPU), uses the CP model and program activities as a foundation.",

Second, although Italy is a high-income country, Italian schools are dealing with a significant number of children with aggressive behaviors, and there is a body of research that supports the effectiveness of a select number of school-based prevention programs for student's behavioral problems (Bradshaw et al. 2009; Durlak et al. 2011) .

Importantly, most of these interventions are not based on empirical theories of aggressive behavior development and there are no universal aggression prevention models rigorously evaluated in Italian school context. Third, through universal interventions, school staff can address the unmet needs of children, especially underserved youth who face heightened stress in less resourced areas (McKay et al. 2004) .

From a prevention standpoint, the effects of CPU on hyperactiveinattentive behaviors are particularly important because they might indicate lower levels of impulsivity and greater inhibitory control in children.
