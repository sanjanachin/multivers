It was a controlled cluster randomized trial with parallel design, including two groups: intervention group [Motivational Interview Group (MIG)], control group [Conventional Intervention Group (CIG)]. Intervention: three face-to-face 30 min' interviews three months apart (only MIG interviews were based on MI principles). Outcomes: change in Children Depression Inventory (CDI) scores. We used a mixed repeated-measures ANOVAs analysis to assess the group vs time interaction. Effect size was calculated for ANOVA with difference of means of the total score (DOMTS). CDI scores were compared by a paired t-test. Eighty-three (84%) adolescents finished the intervention. There was a significant time vs group interaction on both groups. While in the CIG scores significantly increased, in the MIG the scores significantly decreased. The DOMTS was significantly different between the two groups. We concluded that MI showed a positive effect on depression scale scores over time relatively to conventional intervention.",

Our program had the additional advantage of a face-to-face communication with the participant, facilitating the establishment of an empathic therapeutic relation. The decrease of depression scale scores may be partially explained by the fostering of participant's motivation for change in a supportive environment (Beckie et al., 2011; Grote et al., 2007) . MI offers an advantage for ameliorating depressive symptoms over traditional health coaching in that it does not use scaring or confrontational tactics and expresses empathy through reflection by responding to the patient with direct feedback on their statements (Miller and Rollnick, 2012) . Motivational Interviewing is also aimed at increasing autonomous motivation, which is positively related to positive mood during sessions, satisfaction with therapy and positive outcomes in patients with depression (Michalak et al., 2004; Zuroff et al., 2007) . Moreover, MI encourages self-efficacy and the pursuit of positive and enjoyable goals in life, empowering and energizing the patients, an approach that may be especially important for improving mood (Lecci et al., 1994) . Another reason may be related to the strategies used in the implementation of our intervention, designed to better accommodate adolescent's time schedules and place preferences.
