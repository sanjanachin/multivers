        "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in serum and depression in children, and explore the effects of different nursing protocols on patients with low levels of BDNF. We recruited 128 children with depression and 50 healthy subjects. Compared with healthy controls, the mRNA and protein levels of BDNF in serum were lower in children with depression (p<0.01). We selected 60 depressed children with low BDNF and randomly divided them in two groups: comprehensive nursing (n=30) and regular nursing (n=30). Compared to healthy children, there was a significant increase in Hamilton depression (HAMD) scores in patients with depression in childhood (p<0.01). After treatment, BDNF protein expression was higher in the comprehensive nursing group than that in the regular nursing group (p<0.05). Also, the HAMD score in the comprehensive nursing group was significantly lower than that in the regular nursing group (p<0.05). Compliance to treatment and quality of life after treatment improved in the comprehensive nursing group compared with the regular nursing group (p<0.05). Overall, a decrease in BDNF expression is closely correlated with depression, and comprehensive nursing care can significantly ameliorate the depression symptoms in pediatric patients, increase the BDNF expression, and improve compliance and quality of life. These results provide theoretical and practical significance for clinical nursing care of patients with depression in childhood.",

Although some patients maintain a relatively normal mental state in remission after treatment, recurrence can be triggered by social and mental stress, and in extreme cases, patients will commit suicide (11, 12) . BDNF is expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum, with the highest expression corresponding to the hippocampus (13) . Additionally, BDNF can nourish and protect central and peripheral neurons through regulating the metabolism and regeneration of neurons (14) . In this study, we used RT-PCR and western blot analysis to detect the expression level of BDNF in peripheral blood from pediatric patients with depression. Both assays showed that expression of BDNF in the patients was lower than in the control group. Clinical research has shown that BDNF levels in serum is equivalent to those in the brain tissues in depression patients, which is 100 times the level in plasma (15, 16) . Thus, detecting BDNF expression in serum of peripheral blood effectively reflects the brain level of BDNF with the advantage of minimal invasion, simple procedure, and accurate results. According to one study, the expression level of BDNF in depression patients was significantly lower than that in the healthy population, and a lower BDNF expression Compared with the healthy children, the depression in patients is more significant ( a p<0.01).

Severe depression and longer disease course, usually leads to neuronal apoptosis and pyknosis, causing a decrease in the intake of neurotrophic factors. Autopsy investigations showed that after medication of anti-depression drugs, the symptoms are significantly ameliorated and BDNF in the brain increased to normal levels (18) . Therefore, the level of BDNF in the brain is closely correlated with the occurrence and development of depression. Here, we used the HAMD scale to evaluate depression. Pediatric patients with depression with low levels of BDNF were divided into regular and comprehensive nursing groups. Both groups received the same medical treatment, but after 3 months of nursing treatment, the recovery in the comprehensive nursing group was much higher than in the regular nursing group. In addition, we found that compliance and quality of life in the comprehensive nursing group were significantly superior to those in the regular nursing group. These results showed that comprehensive nursing care enhances the treatment for depression. Comprehensive nursing care, through psychological, exercise, and family interventions, can help the patients ameliorate the negative emotions, promote their interest, establish the correct life values, and open their mind, which are of great significance to the treatment of depression (19, 20) .",
