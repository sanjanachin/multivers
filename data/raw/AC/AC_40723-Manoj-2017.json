Many studies have compared the effectiveness and medication acceptance of midazolam via oral and intranasal routes. In this study, we have compared the ease of administration of oral midazolam syrup and intranasal midazolam spray as premedication, administered by parents to children. Methods Ninety children were randomly allocated into one of the two groups: group N received nasal midazolam spray 0.2 mg/kg and group O received oral midazolam syrup 0.5 mg/kg administered by the parent. The parent recorded ease of administration score and facial hedonic score. The observer recorded modified medication acceptance score. Vitals and sedation scores were assessed at specific intervals. Thirty minutes after drug administration the child was separated from the parent, and parental separation anxiety score was recorded. Mask acceptance score was recorded after application of mask upon arrival in the OT. Results Oral midazolam syrup was found to have better ease of administration than intranasal midazolam spray as felt by the parent. Medication acceptance was better for oral midazolam. Both the groups had similar sedation scores at 15 and 30 min. Children in the oral group had a better reduction in parental separation anxiety at 30 min after drug administration and better mask acceptance than the nasal group. ease of administration of midazolam by parents via intranasal and oral routes.

        "text": "The pre-operative assessment was done 1 day before the day of surgery. Parents were taught about the scoring for ease of administration and facial hedonic scale at the time of pre-operative assessment. They were also given a demonstration on how to use the nasal spray and were made to practice on a mannequin using a placebo. Weight, pulse rate, and blood pressure were measured at the time of pre-anesthetic check-up on the day before the surgery. Parental education level was noted and categorized according to the education scale adapted from Kuppuswamy's socioeconomic scale [12] . Patients were made to follow standard fasting guidelines before the surgery. On the day of surgery, the pulse rate was recorded 30 min before entering the operation room (i.e., just before administering the premedication). Patients were randomly allocated into either of the two groups, N and O. Group N received intranasal midazolam spray administered by parents at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg, and group O received oral midazolam syrup administered by parents at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Commercially available oral midazolam syrup (manufactured by M/S Neon Laboratories Limited, India) and midazolam available in the marketplace specially produced for nasal administration (Samarth Pharma Pvt. Ltd) which delivers 0.5 mg midazolam per metered dose (puff) was used in our study. The nasal midazolam bottle is supplied with a nozzle. First, the nozzle should be connected to the bottle, and the child's head should be made straight. Then the nozzle has to be introduced into the nares of the child and the nozzle has to be pressed downwards for the delivery of the drug (shown in Fig. 1 ). The commercially available nasal midazolam delivers 0.5 mg per puff. So first we calculated the dose required for the child and divided it by 0.5 to calculate the number of puffs needed for the child. Then we divided the number of puffs equally between each nostril of the child. For example if the child weighed 10 kg, the dose required was 0.2 \u00d7 10 = 2 mg. As each puff deliver 0.5 mg, the child requires 2/0.5 puffs, i.e., four puffs. So, two puffs in each nostril were administered. If the final amount was not a multiple of 5, then we adjusted the value to the nearby multiple. If the weight was 12 kg, then the dose required was 2.4 mg. It was adjusted to a nearby multiple of 5, i.e., 2.5 and 2.5/0.5 is 5 puffs. Commercially available oral midazolam contains 2 mg/cc of midazolam. First, we calculated the amount required and took the amount in the cup/tumbler supplied by the manufacturer ( Fig. 1) , and administered it. If the child weighed 10 kg then the dose required was 0.5 \u00d7 10 = 5 mg. As the drug is available as 2 mg/cc, the amount required was 5/2 = 2.5 ml. So 2.5 ml of oral midazolam was taken in the cup and administered. Parents were made to score ease of administration and facial hedonic scale just after administering the drug [13, 14] . An observer recorded the modified medication acceptance score [15] . Pulse rate was recorded 10 and 20 min after administering the drug. Sedation scores were recorded at 15 and 30 min after administering the drug [3] . The patient was separated from the parent 30 min after drug administration, and parental separation anxiety score was recorded [3] .",

It is not always practical to have the parent present until anesthesia is induced for children. This makes premedication inevitable for adequate anxiolysis and easy parental separation for children undergoing surgery. Of the various drugs used for premedication for children, midazolam is the most commonly used. Midazolam can be administered via different routes when used as a premedication. But if a stranger administers the drug, that in itself creates anxiety, and we fail in the primary aim of premedication. A known person administering the premedication would eliminate this fear; therefore the parent becomes the best choice. With present research, it has not been determined conclusively which premedication route is easier for the parents to administer that would allow easy separation of children. So we chose two routes of administration, the oral and intranasal routes and compared the ease of administration by parents. It was Wilton et al. who first used the intranasal route for midazolam administration in 1988 and found out that it produced sedation and anxiolysis in children at doses 0.2-0.3 mg/kg [3] . They administered the drug nasally as drops using a syringe. Either the parent or the anesthesiologist administered the drug. Nasal midazolam has also been administered using droppers, atomization and spray devices in previous studies [6, 8, 16] . We used the commercially available midazolam specifically manufactured for nasal administration (Samarth Pharma Pvt. Ltd) in our study, which delivers 0.5 mg midazolam per metered dose and contains 50 metered doses per bottle. The dosages of the drugs were decided to be 0.5 mg/kg for the oral route and 0.2 mg/kg for the intranasal route, based on previous studies. Wilton et al. conducted a study using intranasal midazolam at two different doses of 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg in preschool children in the age group 18 months to 5 years and found that anxiolysis and parental separation was easier with the intranasal route at both the doses [3] . They also found that using a higher dose of Fig. 2 Correlation graphs between ease of administration score and modified medication acceptance score. X-axis is ease of administration score and y-axis is modified medication acceptance score midazolam (> 0.2 mg/kg) failed to provide added benefits because using higher volumes led to excessive coughing and sneezing, and hence the expulsion of the drug. A dose of 0.2 mg/kg was used in our study. According to the study by Feld et al., oral midazolam at doses 0.5 and 0.75 mg/kg were found to provide equally good sedation and anxiolysis in children [4] , so we chose a dose of 0.5 mg/kg for the oral route.",
