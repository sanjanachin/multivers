        "text": "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based participatory nutrition promotion (CPNP) programme involving a 2-week group nutrition session in improving child feeding and hygiene practices among caregivers. Design: Cluster randomized trial. In the intervention area (six clusters), the CPNP programme was added to the context of government nutrition programmes; the control area (six clusters) received the government programme only. Child feeding practices were assessed every 3 months using a 24 h dietary recall questionnaire, and hand washing with soap was assessed every 6 months, over a period of 12 months. Feeding and hygiene measures at each visit were scored and the scores summed up for the entire follow-up period. Setting: Habro and Melka Bello districts, Ethiopia. Subjects: Randomly selected mothers with a child aged 6-12 months (n 1790). Results: A total of 1199 mothers, 629 in the control and 570 in the intervention areas, were assessed at all visits and included in the analysis. Mothers in the intervention area showed higher scores than those in the control area regarding meal frequency (difference: 1\u202204, 95 % CI 0\u202235, 1\u202273), composite feeding score_1 (difference: 1\u202225, 95 % CI 0\u202237, 2\u202213; a summing score of currently breast-feeding, meal frequency and dietary diversity) and composite feeding score_2 (difference: 1\u202240, 95 % CI 0\u202249, 2\u202232; a summing score of meal frequency and dietary diversity). However, there were no differences in the scores of breast-feeding, dietary diversity and hand washing between the two areas (all P > 0\u202205). Conclusions: The CPNP programme was effective in improving some child feeding behaviours in rural Eastern Ethiopia.",

        "text": "The strength of our study was the use of a cluster randomized trial to compare feeding and hygiene practices among a longitudinal cohort of mothers over a 12-month follow-up period. Nevertheless, there are a few limitations that deserve mention here. First, true baseline data for feeding and hygiene practices were not available. This limited our ability to understand the outcomes in feeding and hygiene scores at visit 1. For example, it remained unclear as to how much of the differences observed between intervention and comparison areas were attributable to the CPNP programme, and how much of the differences resulted from variations of the control and intervention areas at enrolment. Considering the decreasing trend of such differences in some outcome scores between the intervention and control areas or between participants and non-participants over the followup, we infer that the programme effects may have already occurred before the first survey visit. This is the reason why we evaluated summary scores over the 12 months of follow-up rather than focusing on outcomes at individual visits. Second, the CPNP programme was not blinded because the CPNP activities could be observed by any community member; however, data collection procedures were standardized and enumerators were trained to remain unbiased towards all mothers to reduce bias. Third, comparability between control and intervention areas was lacking, yet potential confounders were adjusted for in the analysis, which might result in changes in study findings. This suggests that some of these factors (such as household food insecurity) may have influenced behavioural outcomes. Lastly, all assessments relied on maternal recall and were not based on direct observation, so we cannot exclude the possibility that CPNP groups or other mothers in the intervention area might have exhibited higher social desirability to provide the correct answer to the questions asked rather than to report their true practices. This might be a source of bias to the outcomes despite interviewers' training to retain neutral attitudes towards all study mothers. However, given the programme's effects on other health/functional outcomes that we also assessed (19) , our results indicate that the CPNP intervention may have had positive effects and that behaviours may have in fact changed.",

Second, the present study, which followed up a longitudinal group up to 24 months of age, has a limitation in explaining the sustained programme impact after the programme's phase-out. Thus, the impact of the recommended practices needs to be evaluated using cross-sectional surveys of children aged 6-24 months at intervals of several years.

Our study was based on the CPNP programme managed by a non-governmental organization which hired operators and supervisors. After the phase-out of the programme, the study district health offices advocated for the continuation of the CPNP programme and promoted community volunteers as operators.
