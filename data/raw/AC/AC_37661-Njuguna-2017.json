Mortality risk among HIV-infected children initiating ART in hospital is high. [2] [3] [4] While the benefits of initiating ART prior to symptomatic disease in HIV-infected children are well known, the benefit of accelerated ART initiation during hospitalization for severe illness is undefined. Historically, ART initiation is delayed until recovery from acute illness to allow time for standard adherence counseling sessions. However, with this approach, in a previous study in Kenya, a large proportion (41%) of HIV infected infants died before ART initiation at a median of 11 days. 3 Among severely immunosuppressed adults diagnosed with HIV in the setting of an opportunistic co-infection that does not involve the central nervous system (including pneumocystis pneumonia and tuberculosis), there is evidence of survival benefit when ART is initiated within two to four weeks of diagnosis. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Children experience more rapid HIV disease progression and higher early mortality during the first weeks after diagnosis, which may warrant even earlier ART initiation. 3 Accelerating ART initiation during hospitalization could potentially prevent early mortality and allow more rapid immune recovery as rapid quantitative changes in viral load and qualitative and quantitative changes in CD4 may occur within days of treatment. 10, 11 . However, there may be risks of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) due to higher antigen load of co-infecting pathogens in the urgent arm at the start of ART 12 and toxicity of multiple coadministered medications. In addition, it is possible that rapid HIV diagnosis and ART initiation during hospitalization may pose implementation challenges.",

We also used Cox proportional hazard regression and log rank test to compare cumulative incidence of IRIS and drug toxicity. We analyzed data using STATA 12 software (Stata Corporation, USA) and SAS 9 software (SAS Institute, USA). An external Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed the study at sixmonthly intervals and performed interim efficacy and futility analyses using O'Brien-Fleming boundaries when the study had accrued 20% (13 deaths) and 57% (37 deaths) of endpoints (65 deaths). An alternative hypothesis of a hazard ratio of 0\u20225 and null hypothesis of a hazard ratio of 1\u20220 were used to determine efficacy and futility, respectively. The boundary z statistics were calculated using the Lan and DeMet's alpha spending implementation of the O'Brien-Fleming group sequential stopping boundary for a one-sided test with alpha=0\u2022025. If the current z-statistic from the log rank test was less than the benefit boundary z statistic, then that provided evidence to stop the study for benefit. If the current z-statistic from the log rank test was greater than the futility boundary z-statistic, then that provided evidence to stop the study for futility.

Of those enrolled, 81/183 (44%), 50/183 (27%), 43/183 (24%), and 9/183 (5%) were from KNH, JOOTRH, KCH, and MDH respectively. Suspected CNS infection was the main reason for non-randomization among those enrolled (Figure one). Of those randomized to the urgent arm, almost all initiated ART, with fewer in the post stabilization arm initiating ART. Over two thirds of children completed six-month follow-up in the urgent and post-stabilization arms. Almost all randomized children were included in the final modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis. Enrolled children were quite young, the majority were male and were moderately underweight and stunted, and mildly wasted (Table 1) . Almost half were severely malnourished, with WAZ scores less than \u22123 SD. Over a third had been hospitalized prior to the study enrollment hospitalization. The most common comorbidities at enrollment were pneumonia, malnutrition, anemia, dehydration, malaria, gastroenteritis, and suspected tuberculosis. At enrollment, over a quarter of children had hypoxemia (oxygen saturations less than 92%), more than three quarters were on IV antibiotics, and over a fifth had severe acute malnutrition. Children were severely immunosuppressed and almost a fifth had CD4% of less than 5%. In the under two-year, two to five year, and over five year age-groups, the majority were severely immunosuppressed with CD4% of less than 25%, 20% and, 15%, respectively. Children in the urgent arm had significantly lower CD4% than children in the post-stabilization arm (Table one) . Children in the Nairobi sites were significantly younger, had lower HAZ scores, lower CD4%, higher viral load counts, and had more pneumonia diagnoses while those in the Western Kenya sites had significantly more malaria, anemia, and dehydration diagnoses at enrollment (Supplementary table 3 ). Median time to ART initiation after enrollment was one day (IQR 1, 1) in the urgent arm and eight days (IQR 7, 11) in the post-stabilization arm. Most children were initiated on NNRTI-based ART (Table two) . The distribution of ART regimens initiated was similar between arms (Table two) . Among those who initiated TB treatment, median time to TB treatment after enrolment was four days (IQR 1, 8 days). Nine of 181 (5%) children had started TB therapy prior to enrollment.
