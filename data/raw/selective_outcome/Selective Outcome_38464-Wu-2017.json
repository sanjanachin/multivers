Healthy term infants, born within 14 days of the study's commencement, were randomly assigned to be fed IWP-F or HWP-F until 13 weeks of age, and breast-fed (BF) infants were enrolled as a reference group. Anthropometric measurements, gastrointestinal tolerance indexes and stool characteristics were assessed at baseline, and 7 and 13 weeks of age. There were no significant differences in any growth measurements and the occurrence of crying, spit-up and difficult defecation among the three feeding groups during the study period. However, daily feeding frequency was consistently lower in the formula-fed infants than in the BF group throughout the study (p < 0.05), and infants in the HWP-F group consumed more formula than those in the IWP-F group at 7 and 13 weeks of age (p \u2264 0.002). The HWP-F-fed infants had more similar stool characteristics to the breast-fed infants than infants in the IWP-F group at 13 weeks of age, regardless of frequency, volume, color or consistency of stool. This study demonstrates that the HWP-F could support the normal growth of healthy term infants, to a comparable extent to that of breast-fed infants during the first three months of life. Moreover, stool characteristics of HWP-F-fed infants are much closer to breast-fed infants than IWP-F-fed infants, but no significant gastrointestinal tolerance improvement was observed in HWP-F group.",

Regurgitating infants, fed a formula based on whey hydrolysate for a 1-month period, had similar weight gains to those fed a non-hydrolyzed protein formula, and regurgitation times and volume decreased significantly in the hydrolyzed formula fed group [21] . A study by Florendo et al. [22] showed that preterm infants, fed a non-hydrolyzed formula or a partially hydrolyzed whey formula, both had normal gains in weight, length and head circumference, and the infants' mean daily intakes of formula in the two groups were not statistically different. Julie et al. [23] , however, analyzed z-score trajectories across infants aged 2.5 to 7.5 months and found that weight gain was accelerated in the cow-milk-formula-fed health infants, whereas weight gain in the hydrolyzed-formula-fed infants was normative. Moreover, the German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study (GINI) also found that weight gain, length gain and BMI of infants with atopic heredity, who were fed a partially hydrolyzed whey formula (pHF-W), an extensively hydrolyzed whey formula, a cow-milk formula or breast milk were no significantly different during the first 10 years of life, but feeding with extensively hydrolyzed casein (eHF-C) formula led to a transient lower weight gain in the first year of life [24, 25] . In our study, the HWP-F formula, containing hydrolyzed whey protein with 19.6% of peptides less than 2000 Da, and 72.5% of peptides greater than 5000 Da, and the degree of whey protein hydrolysis was much lower than that of commercially pHF-W and eHF-C, manufactured by Nestl\u00e9 and Mead Johnson (Supplementary Materials Figure S1 ) [26] , which could provide safe and adequate amounts of nutrients to keep healthy term infants growing normally during the first three months of life.",
