It may be that this is a moderated relationship in which active learning is beneficial for only some children. This paper examine the impact of baseline academic performance and gender as moderators for the effects of active learning on children's academic performance. In the ASK-study, 1129 fifth-graders from 57 Norwegian elementary schools were randomized by school to intervention or control in a physical activity intervention between November 2014 and June 2015. Academic performance in numeracy, reading, and English was measured and a composite score was calculated. Children were split into low, middle and high academic performing tertiles. 3-way-interactions for group (intervention, control) * gender (boys, girls) * academic performance (tertiles) were investigated using mixed model regression. There was a significant, 3-way-interaction (p = 0.044). Both boys (ES = 0.11) and girls (ES = 0.18) in the low performing tertile had a similar beneficial trend. In contrast, middle (ES = 0.03) and high performing boys (ES = 0.09) responded with small beneficial trends, while middle (ES = \u22120.11) and high performing girls (ES = \u2212 0.06) responded with negative trends. ASK was associated with a significant increase in academic performance for low performing children. It is likely that active learning benefited children most in need of adapted education but it may have a null or negative effect for those girls who are already performing well in the sedentary classroom. Differences in gendered responses are discussed as a possible explanation for these results. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov registry, trial registration number: NCT02132494.",

None of the papers included in two recent reviews (Martin and Murtagh, 2017; Norris et al., 2015) examined whether effects on academic outcomes were moderated by gender. Despite lower levels of PA, on average, elementary school-aged girls generally outperform boys in most school subjects, including core numeracy and literacy (OECD, 2011; Voyer and Voyer, 2014) . In general, this difference might emerge mainly from gendered responses to the learning environment. Specifically, more feminine responses are associated with classroom behavior that is verbal-emotive and marked by the ability to sit still for long durations and multitask, while more masculine responses are less open to sharing and are more 'restless' (Carrier, 2009) . Moreover, elementary schools in many countries record an unequal representation of male and female teachers with female teachers as a large majority (Burusic et al., 2011) . Therefore, instruction in today's elementary school might reside on the feminine side of the gender dimension. Thus, the traditional classroom environment might be a better fit for most girls compared to most boys (Evans, 2017; Renold, 2001 ). Furthermore, boys' higher level of PA compared with girls (Cooper et al., 2015) may reflect a restless inclination to move, which has been associated with masculinity, suggests that boys may be more responsive to PA learning environments than girls.",

In addition, boys engage in significantly more PA than do girls (Cooper et al., 2015) . Given these patterns, there may be a 'gendered' mismatch between boys' preference to be more active and the inactive classroom setting that requires a high degree of sedentary behavior while multi-tasking. Thus, girls could easily thrive in a sedentary classroom setting (Kenney-Benson et al., 2006) , the result could be girls' better academic performance. On the other hand, boys tend to perform poorer in inhibitory control and perceptual sensitivity compared to girls (Else-Quest et al., 2006) . These challenges with attention control for boys might be overcome using physically active learning approaches. In addition, it is well known that children respond differently to an array of educational approaches (e.g. visual, tactile, experiential and so on) (Gardner, 2011) .Therefore, it is likely that some children underperform in the traditional sedentary classroom. These children may also prefer an active academic approach.",

Therefore, the ASK-study may support the overarching aim to enable the school system to give boys and girls equal educational opportunities in life. PA integrated in the curriculum can contribute to decreased social gradients in academic performance and benefit those children most in need of adapted education. Therefore, active learning can be used as a didactic choice of methodology across the curriculum. However, it is important to note that active lessons might have little value or be counterproductive for some children, particularly for high performing girls as demonstrated in the present study. While these findings must be interpreted with caution, they could inspire future school-based PA interventions to be designed to investigate subgroup and gender-specific effects on academic performance.
