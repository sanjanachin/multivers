Participants were randomized to receive either clown (n = 20) or standard (n = 25)-care. Methods Pain Visual-Analogue-Scale (range 1-5) was reported before and after procedures. Pain assessment was lower for children undergoing Botulinum-toxin injections with clown-care (2.89\u00b1 1.36) compared to standard-care (3.85\u00b1 1.39; p = 0.036) even though pain anticipated prior to procedures was similar (~3). Findings Children who underwent the first procedure with clown-care reported lower pain even after they crossed-over to the following procedure which was standard (p = 0.048). Carryover effect was more prominent in injection-na\u00efve children (p = 0.019) and during multiple procedures (p = 0.009). Prior pain experience correlated with pain in subsequent procedures only when first experience was standard-care (p = 0.001). Conclusions Clown-care alleviated pain sensation during Botulinum-toxin injections and initial clown-care experience reduced pain during subsequent injections even though clowns were not present.

        "text": "We found that clown-care is an effective method in reducing pain perception following recurrent BTX injections in children with CP. Most children receiving clown-care reported lower pain levels similar to other clown studies, [25] which is the goal of behavioral and cognitive interventions [20] . Children who did not receive clown care experienced higher levels of pain during the first injection than was anticipated, whereas children receiving clown-care therapy experienced pain equal to or lower than anticipated. This finding was consistent across subsequent injections. This indicates that clown-care can alleviate acute pain and creates resilience for future procedures. Although the clown interaction began before the procedure, it did not relieve anticipated pain before the first experience, indicating that clown care is effective when conducted during the needle procedure itself, not before. First experience was found to crucially affect subsequent injections. Apparently if a child had a specific experience, it was difficult to alter the perceptions, as shown previously in children younger than 8 years [26] . This observation suggests that children are capable of developing memories of pain that can influence their subsequent reactions to similar experiences [27, 28] . Clowning may impact the experience of the first procedure in a purely physiological way. It has been demonstrated that social laughter elevates pain threshold, which provides a possible explanation for the pain difference between the clown-care and control group [29] . Physiological effects of clowning were shown in a randomized control study reporting increased conception following in vitro fertilization procedures with clown-care [30] . The altered pain memory had a carry-over effect to other procedures similar to other pain treatments; effective pain medication alleviates pain in subsequent episodes [31, 32] . However, if the procedure was experienced as traumatic, clowning could not alter this.",
