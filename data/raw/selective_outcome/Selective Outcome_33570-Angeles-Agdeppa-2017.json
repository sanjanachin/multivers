Hb was measured in 2423 schoolchildren aged 6-to 9-years-old at baseline. All anemic children (n = 246) were randomly allocated into groups: Daily dose (HD: high dose), 5X/week (MD: Moderate Dose), 3X/week (LD: Low Dose) and unfortified (Control). Pre-and post-study measurements of micronutrients were collected from 228 children. At the endpoint, significant Hb increases were observed in all groups, but there was no significant difference between groups. There was a significant reduction in anemia prevalence in all groups from 100% to 36% (Control), 30% (LD), 23% (MD) and 26% (HD). No dose-response effect was observed in Hb in this population. Most likely, this resulted from better than expected micronutrient status and lower than expected severity of anemia and micronutrient deficiencies in this cohort. It is unlikely that the addition of a fortified beverage to school feeding programs in this population would have a positive impact. Whether such an intervention would be cost-effective as a preventative approach needs to be assessed. This study demonstrates the importance of targeting such interventions to appropriate populations.",

Mean hemoglobin concentration was significantly lower in the control group (10.8 g/dL) than in the fortified groups (11.1 g/dL) at baseline. The clinical relevance of this difference is marginal in terms of anemia severity (i.e., all groups fell in the same category of mildly anemic). At endpoint, mean hemoglobin had significantly increased in all groups with the highest increase in HD of 1.0 g/dL. The prevalence of anemia, which was 100% at baseline by study design, significantly decreased in all groups with MD having the highest reduction (76.8%) followed by HD (74.1%) while the Control group had 64% and the LD 70%, but no significant intergroup changes were observed (Table 3) . Mean adjusted serum ferritin of the fortified groups increased from baseline to endpoint ranging from 2.2 \u00b5g/L both in LD and HD to 4.5 \u00b5g/L in MD, while Control increased by 3 \u00b5g/L. However, there were no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05). Serum transferrin receptor levels did not differ significantly among all groups at baseline and endpoint. Using both serum transferrin receptor (sTrf > 8.3 mg/L) and corrected serum ferritin (SF < 30 \u00b5g/L) as indicators of iron deficiency, only two children met this criteria (Control = 1; MD = 1) at baseline. Using adjusted serum ferritin level (SF < 30 \u00b5g/L) alone as the criterion, 16 children were iron deficient at baseline but utilizing SF < 15 as the cut-off, only 3 children were found to be iron deficient. At endpoint, only one child (from the MD group) remained iron deficient. Changes in the prevalence of iron deficiency as measured by serum ferritin, serum transferrin, and body iron stores, from baseline to endpoint were not significant between and within groups during the study. In addition, the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency was not associated with the frequency of administration, which indicates that no dose response effect was observed (Table 3) . For other biomarkers, results showed that from baseline to endpoint, there was a significant increase in retinol binding protein (RBP) in all groups; vitamin D status improved in all except LD; vitamin C only improved in those groups consuming the fortified beverage; zinc status was only improved in MD (Table 4) . Dietary intakes at baseline showed that only the mean of the two-day intake of niacin was significantly different between groups with the control group having the lowest (10.2 mg), while HD had the highest intake (14.6 mg). Mean iron intake at baseline was similar in all groups.

The current study found minimal benefit from the intervention across study groups. The most plausible explanation for these findings is the better than expected micronutrient status and the lower than expected prevalence and severity of anemia and micronutrient deficiencies in the study population. The dose of iron in the beverage is relatively low and, although beneficial as a preventive measure for progression to iron deficiency, probably is not high enough to have a statistically significant effect in this relatively iron-replete population. The duration of the study was short and may have required a longer period of administration to demonstrate a positive benefit. Other considerations that may contribute to the findings include the interactions of micronutrients in an aqueous solution, the role of hepcidin in inhibiting iron absorption after dosing, concomitant deficiencies such as folic acid, and the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in the study population. Given the results of this study, and the lower prevalence of anemia and micronutrient deficiencies found in the 2013 national survey, it is unlikely that the addition of a fortified beverage to school feeding programs would carry a significant positive impact. The question of whether such an intervention would be cost-effective as a preventative approach needs to be assessed. As demonstrated by the current study, it is critically important to intervene only when there is a justified need in the population.",
