This study evaluates an intervention for preventing early childhood caries in a pediatric population in Ahvaz, Iran. Method: The population of this study (IRCT2017070210804N10) consists of 104 women with 12 to 36 months of age without dental caries referred to a health care center in Ahvaz, Iran. The children were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group in equal numbers. First, the demographic information of participants was collected through a questionnaire containing components of perceived threat, health literacy, and oral health behaviors using a valid and reliable questionnaire. The ECC status of the children was established by a dentist. Control group received \"standard well baby care\". The experimental group received standard well baby care in addition to educational interventions, including lecture and group discussion. After 6 months, the participant completed the questionnaire for the second time, and the children's teeth were reexamined. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 15 at a significance level of p < 0.05. Results: The mean ages of women and children were 31 \u00b1 6.68 years and 18 \u00b1 7.21 months, respectively. Before the intervention, no significant difference was documented between the groups for the study variables, p > 0.05. However, after the intervention, a significant difference was observed between the perceived threats (41.15 \u00b1 4.46 in the experimental group and 38.26 \u00b1 4.21 in the control group, p = 0.001), health literacy (20.98 \u00b1 2.15 in the experimental group and 19.76 \u00b1 2.70 in the control group, p = 0.01), oral health behaviors (7.75 \u00b1 2.30 in the experimental group and 6.15 \u00b1 2.65 in the control group, p = 0.01), and the incidence of ECC (13% in the experimental group and 35% in the control group, p = 0.001). Conclusion: This intervention had positive effects on the perceived threat, health literacy, and health behaviors; and the intervention could reduce the incidence of ECC. The finding of this study provided a suggestion for evidence-based decision-making processes regarding ECCs prevention programs.",

In addition, participants were given a pamphlet containing brief and important tips on the promotion of educational items, and the need for oral health care for their children. The cost of educational materials was $2 per person. Before the educational session, information about both groups was gathered, and education was delivered to the experimental group in addition to standard childcare procedures. The control group received standard care \"well baby program\", which includes the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) [20] , child growth and development. Through this program, a health care provider measures child's height and weight and marks them on a growth chart. The health care provider uses the chart to determine how the baby is growing compared with other children of the same age and gender.

The results of this study showed the effectiveness of the educational intervention on women's perceived threat regarding ECC. In line with our study, the theory-based studies by Shamsi et al. [19] and Shhnazi et al. [25] proved the perceived threat (including perceived susceptibility and severity) of the need for oral care, specifically regarding dental care for women. However, a study by Moinie et al. [31] demonstrated that the educational program failed to improve perceived susceptibility scores in results that were not consistent with the results of this study. That difference may be explained by their use of peer education, specifically, child-to-child, which led to less effectiveness when compared to education by dentists; as a result, there was less susceptibility to perceiving a threat to oral health as compared to our study. Regarding the increased perceived threat for women with children younger than 3-years-old, family health personnel and dentists must act to increase the education of the women, by providing statistics on the prevalence of ECC in children younger than 36 months of age, their complications, and their effects on many aspects of general well-being.",
