Drawing from the qualitative findings, cultural and religious concepts relevant to family functioning and resilience were incorporated throughout Happy Families.

Some of the most substantive changes made to the intervention included: expansion of content on anger and stress management, including incorporation of meditation, a common Buddhist practice; additional explanation and role plays of the \"planned ignoring\" parenting strategy, as it was difficult to understand during piloting; and inclusion of traditional Burmese stories and examples related to the specific stressors of displacement. In addition, simplifications of concepts were made throughout, the age range for children was raised by two years (i.e., the original plan was to include children beginning at age 6), handouts were eliminated given limited literacy, and the length was reduced from to 12 sessions due to restrictions on participants' time and movements.

According to the underlying theory of change related to the primary outcomes, the intervention was expected to achieve acquisition of both knowledge and skills among both caregivers and children primarily through active skill-building paired with didactic components.

Results provide consistent evidence that the treatment improved the quality of parent-child relationships among migrant Burmese families through both increased positive relationship behaviors and decreased negative interactions.

Thus, for these families, improving relationship quality and family dynamics might have been more salient goals than learning specific strategies to respond to or prevent negative behaviors.
