Design: A randomised controlled trial evaluation of a community-based home visiting programme. The intervention involved biweekly visits from mentors from pregnancy until age 5 years and parent training at age 2 years. Dietary intake was assessed at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months using an FFQ to calculate the proportion meeting dietary recommendations. Cognitive functioning was measured at 24 and 36 months. Treatment effects were estimated using conventional \u03c7 2 tests, permutation testing, inverse probability weighting and the stepdown procedure. Mediation analysis examined the indirect effect of the intervention on cognitive functioning via its effect on dietary intake. Setting: Socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Subjects: Pregnant women (n 233) were assigned to the intervention (n 115) or control (n 118) group using an unconditional probability randomisation strategy. Results: Positive treatment effects were observed for meeting dietary recommendations for protein foods at 24 (OR = 2\u202252) and 36 (OR = 2\u202242) months, and all food groups at 24 (OR = 3\u202292) months. There were no effects on grain, dairy, fruit and vegetable, or fatty/sugary food recommendations in most models. The conventional and more novel methods yielded similar results. Mediation analysis indicated that 13 % of the intervention's effect on cognitive functioning was mediated by 36-month protein food consumption. Conclusions: The study demonstrates some potential to alter early childhood dietary patterns through community-based intervention programmes.",

While over two-thirds of the sample met recommendations for grains and dairy by age 3 years, less than one-third met protein and fruit and vegetable recommendations, and over one-third were eating fatty and sugary foods on a daily basis. This suggests that targeted interventions among low-SES populations are needed to improve dietary patterns early in life. From a policy perspective, the effects for diet and cognitive development may have economic relevance. A cost-benefit analysis of multiple, primarily US-based, HVP found returns ranging from $US 0\u202221 to $US 30\u202246 per $US invested, with a median return of $US 1\u202262 (52) . The proportion of the return generated from health-care saving amounted to~10 % and the proportion generated by improvements in labour market and educational outcomes was~70 %. As the PFL intervention had some an impact on improving diet and cognitive functioning, the intervention may generate similar positive returns in the long run; thus future work should include a cost-benefit analysis. In addition, future HVP studies should evaluate dietary intake, as well as complementary and early childhood feeding practices, while interventions focused on dietary change or obesity prevention should incorporate measures of child development.

            "The findings reported here may have implications for both practice and policy.",
            "While over two-thirds of the sample met recommendations for grains and dairy by age 3 years, less than one-third met protein and fruit and vegetable recommendations, and over one-third were eating fatty and sugary foods on a daily basis.",
            "This suggests that targeted interventions among low-SES populations are needed to improve dietary patterns early in life.",
            "From a policy perspective, the effects for diet and cognitive development may have economic relevance.",
            "A cost-benefit analysis of multiple, primarily US-based, HVP found returns ranging from $US 0\u202221 to $US 30\u202246 per $US invested, with a median return of $US 1\u202262 (52) .",
            "The proportion of the return generated from health-care saving amounted to~10 % and the proportion generated by improvements in labour market and educational outcomes was~70 %.",
            "As the PFL intervention had some an impact on improving diet and cognitive functioning, the intervention may generate similar positive returns in the long run; thus future work should include a cost-benefit analysis.",
            "In addition, future HVP studies should evaluate dietary intake, as well as complementary and early childhood feeding practices, while interventions focused on dietary change or obesity prevention should incorporate measures of child development.",
            "Finally, studies investigating the effects of combined nutrition-child development interventions are also warranted.",
