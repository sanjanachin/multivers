In this randomized controlled clinical trial, subjects were randomized in terms of equal confounding variables (including age, gender, weight, type and diameter of the foreign body as well as delay before the initiation of the treatment) as demonstrated by the statistical similarity between groups in terms of these variables (P>0.05).

Previous studies have reported controversial findings in terms of hemodynamic effects of controlled and spontaneous ventilation. In contrast to the findings of this study, a recent meta-analysis reported no significant difference in oxygen desaturation between spontaneous and controlled ventilation (11) . Furthermore, in another study on 83 patients with tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration, respiratory complications were present in 18% of subjects who underwent total intravenous anesthesia and assisted ventilation (17) . These complications included reduced oxygen saturation, bronchospasm and recurrent pneumothorax (17) . Conversely, Soodan et al. (2004) reported that all their subjects in the spontaneous ventilation group (n=36) required assisted ventilation due to reduced oxygen saturation or unacceptable depth of anesthesia (8) . In another study in 46 patients with foreign body aspiration who underwent rigid bronchoscopy, spontaneous ventilation was considered safe due to the observed similarities in outcomes of intravenous and inhalation rout of anesthesia (18) . They also suggested that prior experience and close cooperation between the otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist should be taken into consideration in the choice of spontaneous or controlled ventilation in the management of foreign body aspiration (18) . This study also revealed a significant association between surgeon satisfaction and the controlled ventilation procedure. Due to the paucity of data on the effectiveness of spontaneous ventilation against controlled ventilation, it is still early to obtain a concise conclusion. However, it can be inferred from the current study that controlled ventilation might be a good and acceptable choice in the management of tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration in children. Furthermore, because surgeon satisfaction was significantly higher with controlled ventilation, this procedure might prove a better approach for surgeons in the bronchoscopic removal of foreign bodies. There is a need for further studies with larger sample sizes in order to assure the safety or possible superiority of controlled ventilation in comparison with spontaneous ventilation. One of the limitations of this study is the small sample size. Although the sample size of the study reached the minimum required sample size, time restrictions and the emergency nature of the condition prevented the researchers from including more subjects in the study. This limitation may have prevented us from generalizing the results to the whole population of children with foreign body aspiration. Another limitation of the study is the use of a binary scale for surgeon satisfaction due to their busy schedule. Since surgeons have an important role in the management of these emergencies, it is recommended that further studies perform an in-depth assessment of the satisfaction of the surgeons.",
