Strategies aimed at strengthening resilience protective factors provide a potential approach for reducing mental health problems in adolescents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a universal, school-based intervention targeting resilience protective factors in reducing mental health problems in adolescents. A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in 20 intervention and 12 control secondary schools located in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of NSW, Australia. Data were collected from 3115 students at baseline (Grade 7, 2011), of whom 2149 provided data at follow up (Grade 10, 2014; enrolments in Grades 7 to 10 typically aged 12e16 years; 50% male; 69.0% retention). There were no significant differences between groups at follow-up for three mental health outcomes: total SDQ, internalising problems, and prosocial behaviour. A small statistically significant difference in favour of the control group was found for externalising problems. Findings highlight the continued difficulties in developing effective, school-based prevention programs for mental health problems in adolescents.",

Protective factors for resilience include both internal factors (e.g. self-efficacy, effective problem solving); and external factors within the wider social environment (e.g. meaningful participation within home, school or community environments) (Cowen et al., 1996; Fergus & Zimmerman, 2005; Lee & Stewart, 2013; Sun & Stewart, 2010) . Theoretical models of resilience are centrally concerned with positive adaptation and are commonly based on the premise that protective factors act as moderators that reduce the impact of deleterious factors such as risk factors or adversity, reducing the impact of negative outcomes (such as prevalence of mental health problems), and promoting positive outcomes (such as positive mental health) (Fergus & Zimmerman, 2005; Friedli, 2009) . This suggestion is supported by results of previous research, which has found high levels of protective factors to be associated with lower levels of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, stress and obsessive-compulsive disorder in adolescents (Bond, Toumbourou, Thomas, Catalano, & Patton, 2005; Hjemdal, Friborg, Stiles, Rosenvinge, & Martinussen, 2006; Hjemdal, Vogel, Solem, Hagen, & Stiles, 2011) .",

Aspects of the role of the school intervention officers included providing ongoing monitoring of implementation and performance feedback to schools. Additionally, to encourage ownership and leadership in the implementation of the intervention within schools, a school core team was established (Wyn et al., 2000) . In each intervention school, core team members included the allocated school intervention officer, student leaders, school staff including the school liaison officer and a minimum of one executive school staff member (e.g. principal, deputy principal and/or head of faculty). School core teams held regular meetings (on average twice per school Term; 4 Terms per year) during which they received proactive support from the allocated school intervention officer to: audit school implementation progress and current challenges within their school community, and; develop annual action plans for implementation of locally chosen program content or strategies that were tailored to their school community and that addressed each of the prescribed intervention strategies. A standard agenda was available to schools for core team meetings, and school intervention officers facilitated team meetings. Additionally school intervention officers and intervention school staff were provided with opportunities to complete courses in Mental Health First Aid (Mental Health First Aid, 2016) or MindMatters (BeyondBlue and the Department of Health of the Australian Government, 2016).",
