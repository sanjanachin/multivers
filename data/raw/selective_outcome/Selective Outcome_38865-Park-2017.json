The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine with that of fentanyl as an adjuvant to epidural ropivacaine in pediatric orthopedic surgery. Materials and Methods: This study enrolled 60 children (3-12 years old) scheduled for orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities and lumbar epidural patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Children received either dexmedetomidine (1 \u03bcg/kg) or fentanyl (1 \u03bcg/kg) along with 0.2% ropivacaine (0.2 mL/kg) via an epidural catheter at 30 minutes before the end of surgery. Postoperatively, the children were observed for ropivacaine consumption via epidural PCA, postoperative pain intensity, need for rescue analgesics, emergence agitation, and other adverse effects. Results: The mean dose of bolus epidural ropivacaine was significantly lower within the first 6 h after surgery in the dexmedetomidine group, compared with the fentanyl group (0.029\u00b10.030 mg/kg/h vs. 0.053\u00b10.039 mg/kg/h, p=0.012). The median pain score at postoperative 6 h was also lower in the dexmedetomidine group, compared to the fentanyl group [0 (0-1.0) vs. 1.0 (0-3.0), p=0.039]. However, there was no difference in the need for rescue analgesia throughout the study period between groups. Conclusion: The use of dexmedetomidine as an epidural adjuvant had a significantly greater analgesic and local anesthetic-sparing effect, compared to fentanyl, in the early postoperative period in children undergoing major orthopedic lower extremity surgery.",

Dexmedetomidine causes local vasoconstriction and hyperpolarization, delaying the absorption of local anesthetics and prolonging their effects. [17] [18] [19] Another possible mechanism is its central analgesic effect through spinal and supraspinal actions, inhibiting the activation of spinal astrocytes and microglia, decreasing the release of nociceptive substances, and regulating nociceptive transmission. 20, 21 After epidural administration, dexmedetomidine rapidly diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid and reaches binding sites in the spinal cord because of its lipophilicity, and its analgesic effect is up to five times greater with epidural administration compared with systemic administration. 22 When adding an adjuvant to epidural local anesthetics in children, the most important issues should be the safety and side-effect profile of the drug, as well as using the lowest effective dose.

Moreover, the required bolus doses of ropivacaine were decreased by roughly 50% during the first 6 h after surgery when dexmedetomidine was used, compared to fentanyl.

        "text": "In conclusion, our results suggest that dexmedetomidine can be used safely as an epidural adjuvant in children undergoing major lower extremity procedures when given as a single dose at the end of surgery. The main advantage of dexmedetomidine over fentanyl seems to be more effective analgesia during the early postoperative period, without causing any hemodynamic complications or oversedation. Special populations that are more susceptible to local anesthetic toxicity and side effects of opioids may benefit from using dexmedetomidine as an epidural adjuvant after extensive correctional orthopedic surgery.",
