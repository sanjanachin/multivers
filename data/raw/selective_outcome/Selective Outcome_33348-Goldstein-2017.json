Method: Effects of a supplemental intervention targeting academic vocabulary in first through third grades were evaluated with 241 students (6-9 years old) from low-income families, 48% of whom were retained for the 3-year study duration. Students were randomly assigned to vocabulary instruction or comparison groups. Results: Curriculum-based measures of word recognition, receptive identification, expressive labeling, and decontextualized definitions showed large effects for multiple levels of word learning. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that students with higher initial Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Fourth Edition scores (Dunn & Dunn, 2007) demonstrated greater word learning, whereas students with special needs demonstrated less growth in vocabulary. Conclusion: This model of vocabulary instruction can be applied efficiently in high-poverty schools through an automated, easily implemented adjunct to reading instruction in the early grades and holds promise for reducing gaps in vocabulary development.",

Word learning begins when infants isolate and store sound segments garnered from the sound stream of their native language (Saffran, Werker, & Werner, 2006) . At approximately 6 months of age, infants can recognize frequently heard words, for example, their own names (Bortfeld, Morgan, Golinkoff, & Rathbun, 2005) , and by 10-12 months of age, children are linking words to objects or concepts to which they have frequent exposure (Nelson, 1973; Phythian-Sence & Wagner, 2007) . By 30 months, estimates for expressive vocabularies range from 360 to 630 words, and estimates or receptive vocabularies are even larger (Fenson et al., 1994; Tomasello, 2003) . But Rowe, Raudenbush, and Goldin-Meadow (2012) found that children with lower vocabularies at 30 months demonstrated reduced vocabulary growth over time, thus jeopardizing their school readiness. In fact, researchers have demonstrated that the size of children's receptive and expressive vocabulary in the second year of life predicts later vocabulary, phonological awareness, reading accuracy, and reading comprehension (Duff, Reen, Plunkett, & Nation, 2015; Lee, 2011) .",

Children are thought to learn words incrementally through multiple exposures in various contexts (Anderson & Nagy, 1991; Beck, McKeown, & Omanson, 1987; Dale, 1965; Hatch & Brown, 1995; Stahl, 1986) . This learning process facilitates deeper word knowledge than a single exposure (Bolger, Balass, Landen, & Perfetti, 2008) . Investigators have indicated that preschoolers (Hadley, Dickinson, Hirsch-Pasek, Golinkoff, & Nesbitt, 2015) and kindergarteners (Christ, 2011) go through several stages when learning new words. For example, Dale (1965) outlined a typical progression for learning novel vocabulary words. These stages are as follows: Level 1, \"never heard it before\"; Level 2, \"heard it, but do not know what it means\"; Level 3, \"recognize it in context as having something to do with____\"; Level 4, \"know it well.\" Not until knowledge of a given word reaches Level 3 is the child able to identify it, use it, and/or provide attributes of it within a context. Once Level 4 is reached, the child can define the word, use it in more than one context, and provide salient attributes without a defined context. Children who have more words in their vocabulary at Levels 3 and 4 will demonstrate better reading comprehension and better use of context clues when novel words are encountered (NRP, 2000) . These developmental levels seem to correspond to depth of knowledge. When vocabulary is being taught explicitly, researchers can use multiple measures of word learning to begin to determine if the developmental process progresses as hypothesized by Dale and others (Beck et al., 1987; Hatch & Brown, 1995; Stahl, 1986) .",

However, recent education policies seem to recognize the need for proficient academic oral language to enable students to access content in academic texts and to develop high-level academic discourse (Bailey & Heritage, 2008) . For example, the majority of states have elected to adopt the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010). The Language Arts and Literacy strands contain clear guidance about the hierarchical grade-level skills in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language that students are expected to master from kindergarten to 12th grade. One important component in the Language Arts strand is academic vocabulary. Academic vocabulary refers to words that occur frequently across the curriculum in spoken or written academic discourse (Baumann & Graves, 2010; Coxhead, 2000; Marzano & Pickering, 2005) . These words are fundamental for text comprehension (Beck & McKeown, 2007) . They are considered to have a high probability of not being known by students (Hiebert & Lubliner, 2008) . Precise meanings of academic words vary based on context, for example, operation, specific, investigate (Beck, McKeown, & Kucan, 2002; Marzano & Pickering, 2005) . Learning academic vocabulary words and understanding their specialized meanings may be particularly challenging for children who lack a rich foundational vocabulary (Stahl & Nagy, 2006) . Direct instruction on academic vocabulary words beyond what is targeted in the general curriculum may be the only means for children at risk to increase the breadth and depth of their vocabularies needed to boost their academic achievement. Beck et al. (2002) proposed a tiered system to prioritize vocabulary for instruction. Tier 1 contains basic words that rarely require direct instruction (e.g., boy); Tier 3 words are situation specific and are seldom used outside of a specific context (e.g., decibel). In contrast, Tier 2 words are found across a variety of linguistic and academic environments (e.g., layer, consequence, adult). Academic vocabulary incorporates both Tier 2 and Tier 3 and is of considerable importance for developing the academic language needed for children to be successful in many different content areas (Nagy & Townsend, 2012) . However, Beck et al. (2002) suggest prioritizing Tier 2 words to maximize the impact on oral and reading vocabulary knowledge of children who are at risk for developing reading disabilities.

However, when low SES status was combined with at least one other risk factor (e.g., second language status, low academic achievement, special education status), differential effects were significant.

The goal in developing supplemental programming is to provide additional vocabulary instruction in an attempt to close the ever widening early vocabulary gap in the primary grades (Walker, Greenwood, Hart, & Carta, 1994) . For example, Puhalla (2011) provided 22 randomly assigned first-grade students supplemental explicit instruction on 19 storybook vocabulary words extracted from the classroom-based Read Aloud curriculum. Students receiving scripted, 20-min lessons with explicit definitions and extension activities such as word play on the targeted vocabulary scored higher on a researcher-developed curriculum-based assessment, when compared to a no-treatment control. Medium to large effect sizes were noted, but the investigators did not provide specific results of word learning for the targeted 19 words. In another supplemental program, Apthorp (2006) utilized a published vocabulary guide, Elements of Reading (EOR): Vocabulary, Level C. Teachers used a scripted guide and student book to deliver 20 min of daily wholeclassroom supplemental instruction that focused on seven words per week to third-grade students in seven Title I schools across two states for 24 weeks (i.e., a total of 168 words). Fifteen teachers were randomly assigned to use the intervention or continue to provide instruction as usual. Instead of assessing word knowledge on the 168 words targeted in the intervention, the investigator utilized a standardized test of oral and sight vocabulary. The supplemental instruction teachers produced significantly better effects in the lower-income state, but not the other state. Even with improved outcomes, the students in the treatment classrooms did not reach grade-level expectations on tests of reading vocabulary and comprehension. Loftus et al. (2010) investigated supplementary vocabulary interventions via shared storybook reading for 20 at-risk kindergarten students who participated in a whole-classroom shared story book reading instructional component supplemented by a 2-week, 30-min intervention that focused on (a) a review of the target word meanings, (b) student elaboration and extension of vocabulary word learning, and (c) individual feedback provided by graduate student interventionists. Students in the experimental group received 4 hr of instruction on eight target vocabulary words. Researchers assessed word meanings based on a continuum of partial word knowledge to complete knowledge. Students who received the supplemental instruction significantly increased their knowledge of vocabulary as evidenced by researchermade measures of word recognition (86%), context questions (26%), and expressive definitions (28%). Effect sizes ranged from 0.42 to 0.69. Word learning in the at-risk experimental group approached those of their not at-risk peers who received classroom instruction but did not match those gains.",

Vocabulary learning varied based on the level of vocabulary knowledge demonstrated by various measures. Of the 324 academic vocabulary words taught in 3 years, children in the experimental group recognized a mean of 298 words (92%). The large effect size (M = 1.75) reflects recognition of words 33% above chance compared to 13% above chance for the comparison group. The experimental group receptively identified a mean of 234 words (72%). The large effect size (M = 1.77) reflects receptive identification of words 38% above chance compared to 16% above chance for the comparison group. These group differences are not surprising, but we thought that the comparison group might have heard some of the target words before (word recognition), but that they would be less likely to demonstrate comprehension on the receptive identification task. However, when we take into account chance performance, the comparison group seemed to perform similarly on these two tasks despite what we would consider different levels of knowledge, albeit an average of less than one word per week. Chance level of performance makes these results difficult to interpret with confidence. Nevertheless, there was clearly a ceiling effect for word recognition among second and third graders in the experimental group and consistently large group differences for word recognition and receptive identification tasks. Chance performance is not a factor for the expressive labeling and decontextualized definition tasks. The experimental group expressively labeled a mean of 135 pictures (42%) and defined a mean of 70 words (22%). This compares to knowledge of a mean of 10-12 (3%-4%) words for the comparison group. Because of these multiple measures, these results provide an indication of deeper knowledge of learning of targeted vocabulary words. Performance of the various vocabulary assessments was consistent with our predictions with the best performance on the Level 2 recognition task and poorest performance on the Level 4 decontextualized definition task.

Indeed, as we began to exhaust words from the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) , we were left with more abstract words that were difficult to incorporate into stories and the Living Word List (Dale & O'Rourke, 1976 ) was used to augment word selection. Some support for this word difficulty hypothesis is evident when examining vocabulary performance for the comparison group. Although performing much lower than the vocabulary instruction group, the comparison group also performed better in second grade than third grade. Research is needed to determine how to scale words, specifically academic vocabulary words, for longitudinal intervention studies. The Coxhead (2000) approach of scaling words based on their frequencies in textbooks across disciplines seems like a reasonable approach to identifying potential target words. The vocabulary is naturally academic given the data source and the use across disciplines helps distinguish between what would be considered Tier 2 versus Tier 3 words. Of course, target word selection also must consider other factors, as interventionists must identify corresponding pictures (i.e., imageability) and definitions simple enough for children to understand. A second possible reason for the decrement was the procedural change in third grade, as anchor words were no longer incorporated into training to accommodate longer stories that were used in the fluency practice for both groups. Although anchor words were excluded from vocabulary learning results, it could be that they serve a positive function. Ensuring a certain level of success with familiar words may enhance motivation in responding to more difficult, academic Tier 2 words.",

By evaluating the effects of vocabulary instruction over 3 years, we could describe vocabulary learning over time. In particular, we were able to describe absolute word learning (i.e., average number of words learned) on multiple measures. This also allowed for an examination of the depth of word learning, and results clearly indicated different levels of word learning on measures that tapped lower versus higher levels of word knowledge. Despite considerable attrition, a rigorous experimental design allowed results to be presented in growth curve analyses that also provided an examination of moderating effects. Differential responses to intervention were revealed based on both entry-level vocabulary knowledge as well as IEP status.",

The method of direct, explicit teaching of academic vocabulary embedded in children's stories seems to show great promise for students at risk for language or literacy difficulties. Indeed, the use of recorded lessons and minimal instructional materials seems feasible for widespread application with children in high-poverty schools. Our explicit vocabulary instruction provided ample opportunities for children to respond to instruction individually, albeit at the same time. It is critical that academic vocabulary be an instructional focus for students at risk for reading delays or academic underachievement.
