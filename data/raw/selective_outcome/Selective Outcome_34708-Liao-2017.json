        "text": "The aim of this study is to investigate the biomechanics for orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) subjected to concurrent single-tooth vibration (50 Hz) with conventional orthodontic force application, via a clinical study and computational simulation. Thirteen patients were recruited in the clinical study, which involved distal retraction of maxillary canines with 1.5 N (150 g) force for 12 weeks. In a split mouth study, vibration and non-vibration sides were randomly assigned to each subject. Vibration of 50 Hz, of approximately 0.2 N (20 g) of magnitude, was applied on the buccal surface of maxillary canine for the vibration group. A mode-based steady-state dynamic finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted based on an anatomically detailed model, complying with the clinical protocol. Both the amounts of space closure and canine distalization of the vibration group were significantly higher than those of the control group, as measured intra-orally or on models (p < 0.05). Therefore it is indicated that a 50 Hz and 20 g single-tooth vibration can accelerate maxillary canine retraction. The volume-average hydrostatic stress (VHS) in the periodontal ligament (PDL) was computationally calculated to be higher with vibration compared with the control group for maxillary teeth and for both linguo-buccal and mesial-distal directions. An increase in vibratory frequency further amplified the PDL response before reaching a local natural frequency. An amplification of PDL response was also shown to be induced by vibration based on computational simulation. The vibration-enhanced OTM can be described by mild, vigorous and diminishing zones among which the mild zone is considered to be clinically beneficial.",

It is suggested that mild amplification of the PDL pressure, while being insufficiently high to cause necrosis of the structures, may actuate the relevant cells and biochemical factors such as RANKL, TGF-b and OPG and hence enhances the biological events responsible for OTM. The vibration oriented in line with the OTM direction, i.e. MD direction in this case, did not visibly enhance the PDL response more than the LB group ( Fig. 4a and b ). In the clinical study, vibration was also applied in a different direction to that of OTM. Both computational and clinical studies indicated that random vibration could facilitate OTM. The mild response zone, under a low-medium frequency vibration, is proposed to be favored clinically. No extremely excessive pressure, additional to the pressure induced by static orthodontic force, is generated within this range where relevant cells and factors may however respond and take effect.",

The dynamic vibration was only introduced 10 min/day in our study. The application of vibration was not lasting and hence the amplification of the PDL response. In other words, the short duration of vibration application, along with its potential to accelerate OTM, implies that the vibration stimulates OTM-related cells and factors Fig. 4 . The vibration-induced amplification of pressure in maxillary teeth's PDL for (a) mesio-distal and (b) linguo-buccal vibration during tooth distalization. PDL responses versus different vibratory frequencies: (c) low-medium frequencies directed in the mesio-distal direction. (d) low-medium frequencies directed in the lingual-buccal direction. (e) low-high frequencies in the mesio-distal direction. (f) low-high frequencies in the lingual-buccal direction. through this temporarily sustained and dynamic amplification of pressure level within the PDL. It is also speculated that the transformation of forcing nature and the fluctuation of hydrostatic pressure within the PDL may contribute to the activation at a cellular level. Transformation of microcirculatory condition, e.g. increase of blood flow rate within the PDL possibly induced by the vibration (Nakagami et al., 2007; Nishimura et al., 2008) and hence the activity level of bone remodeling, may be another key factor contributing to OTM acceleration. The results of this study echoed several previous studies, including two animal studies by Darendeliler et al. (2007) and Nishimura et al. (2008) , in which it was claimed that vibration enhances OTM, and several clinical studies by Kau et al. (2010) , Bowman (2014) , Leethanakul et al. (2015) and Pavlin et al. (2015) , in which the AcceleDent vibrator (30 Hz, all-teeth vibration) or electric toothbrush were also found to accelerate OTM. Likewise, several in vitro studies have shown that low magnitude high frequency (LMHF) vibration or cyclic tensile loading can promote human PDL stem cells (PDLSCs) or PDL cells (PDLCs) proliferation (Matsuda et al., 1998; Yousefian et al., 1995) or osteogenic differentiation without detriment to the vitality of the PDL cells (Zhang et al., 2012) . However, conflicting results were obtained from the studies by Woodhouse et al. (2015) and Miles et al. (2012) when using AcceleDent devices and Tooth Masseuse vibrator respectively, as they found no evidence supporting the beneficial effects of supplemental vibrational force on OTM. This discrepancy may arise from two reasons. Firstly, all-teeth vibration can be less controllable than single-tooth vibration. The vibration received by the target tooth for the former is likely to be of much lower frequency or amplitude due to unfavorable tooth positioning and morphology, which may lead to insufficient contact between tooth and vibrating medium. Secondly, the energy loss during vibration delivery has been largely ignored in most studies. Energy dissipation is a consequence of many mechanical related factors such as damping and friction. As a consequence the amplitude of force and frequency received by the target dental structure can be considerably lower than the motor vibrating frequency which was sometimes labeled as the tooth vibrating frequency. In this study, the rotor frequency was measured to be 113 Hz using an optical tachometer. This was over 50% higher than what was eventually transmitted to the vibrator terminal or maxillary canine (50 Hz). Therefore, it is suggested that single-tooth vibration and accurate measurement of vibrating frequency should be necessitated to investigate the vibratory effects.",
