Methods: Secondary data analyses were performed on socio-demographic, health-related, and socio-cognitive moderators of intervention efficacy. Students attending 80 vocational and upper secondary school classes with different levels of alcohol use were randomized to either a web-and text messaging-based intervention (n = 547) or an assessment-only control group (n = 494). Moderators of outcome were analysed across the entire sample, and separately for lower-risk and higher-risk drinkers. Results: Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, we identified smoking status and educational level to moderate the intervention effectiveness across the total sample and in the lower-risk subsample, with a greater reduction in binge-drinking prevalence in smokers versus non-smokers, and in more highly-educated versus less-educated adolescents. Conclusions: Technology-based interventions targeting heavy drinking might be especially effective in smokers and highly-educated adolescents. Interventions can prevent low-risk drinkers that smoke from developing a problematic alcohol use.",
