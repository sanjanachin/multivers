        "text": "Multi-step testing block. The testing block consisted of 24 videos. In these videos, an array of blue rectangles, similar to those seen in the training blocks, were presented and were then occluded after 3 seconds. Following occlusion, the child saw the multiplication wand wave over the occluded array and disappear off-screen left (a 2-s event), followed one second later by the division wand, which waved over the array and disappeared off-screen left (a 2-s event). Following the appearance of both the multiplication and division wands, an array of pink rectangles appeared 3 s later on the right side of the screen. In a change from the training trials, after the child indicated which side of the screen she or he believed to have more shapes, the occluder did not drop to reveal the correct transformed amount beneath the screen. After the child answered, they were not told whether or not they answered correctly; instead, the experimenter provided uniformly positive feedback (\"Good job! You're doing great! Let's try another\") and moved on to the next video. Furthermore, the comparison arrays did not look like those shown in the training blocks; rather, they were similar in terms of area, contour length, and convex hull, with the goal that the child would be attentive to numerical magnitude over these variables. That is, each set of comparison arrays within each multi-step testing problem (e. g., 8, 14, 18, 22, 28, or 40 *2/2 or *4/4) had similar area, perimeter, and convex hull (e.g., identical with some random variability programmed in), though the measurements across each problem differed. Density is challenging to hold steady across a range of small and large values, given placement constraints on large items, and if one holds convex hull steady across arrays, density will vary with the number of objects. Thus, more numerous sets within a range of comparison array values tended to have greater density. If the child were responding on the basis of area, contour length, or convex hull instead of the numerosity of the comparison area during the training blocks (recall that these variables scaled up or down alongside the number of objects in the comparison array for training), they would perform only at chance during test trials, because in these test trial comparison arrays, that type of information does not vary within a given scaling problem. For example, in the test videos of 14 * 2/2 = 7 versus 14, 14 * 2/2 = 9 versus 14, 14 * 2/2 = 21 versus 14, and 14 * 2/2 = 28 versus 14, the values for 7, 9, 21, and 28 objects were all area = 55 to 60 cm 2 , contour length = 54 to 56 cm 2 , convex hull = \u223c44 to 47 cm, and the density for the 7-object array was approximately one quarter that of the 28-object array. Density did vary with number (more numerous arrays were denser), though this would be unlikely to be brought over as a strategy from the training trials, because in those training trials density was equated across all comparison arrays and thus could not be used to help solve the greater/fewer task at hand. Thus, the overall area and contour length of the comparison arrays were all equidistant from the (imagined, never-revealed) outcome arrays on these spatial extent variables. Again, take the example of the test trials 14 * 2/2 = 7 versus 14, 14 * 2/2 = 9 versus 14, 14 * 2/2 = 21 versus 14, and 14 * 2/2 = 28 versus 14. The comparison arrays had an area = 55 to 60 cm 2 , contour length = 54 to 56 cm, and convex hull = \u223c44 to 47 cm, and the density for the 7-object array was \u223c1 object per 10 cm 2 and for the 28-object array \u223c3.5 object per 10 cm 2 . The (potentially imagined, based on what they saw at training) outcome array has an area = 9 cm 2 , perimeter = 82 cm, convex hull = 45 cm, and a density of \u223c2.25 objects per 10 cm 2 . Though the children never saw the outcome arrays during the testing blocks, control of this factor discouraged the potential strategy of comparing the area or contour length of the imagined original outcome array to the presented comparison array. In this way, children were encouraged to attend to numerical values, rather than perceptual variables that vary along with number. The initial values used in the testing section were different from those in the training blocks, in order to avoid any performance boosts from rote memorization of the training trials (see Table 1 for the specific values used).",

This performance benefit for multiplication over division was also found in Experiment 1. However, one should use caution before concluding that scaling down the number of objects in a set is harder than scaling up. First, the division training was always given after the multiplication training in this design, which could readily lead to interference between the two processes. Second, a similar scaling paradigm used by McCrink and Spelke (2010, 2015) found no differences in overall performance as a function of operation type (multiplication/division) when the two processes were presented in isolation across children. The children in the current experiment also exhibited signs of using an extraneous, non-arithmetic range-based strategy when faced with these challenging division and multi-operation testing trials. This supports the idea that children may reach for alternative strategies to support their arithmetic reasoning in challenging situations (Siegler, 1987; Shrager & Siegler, 1998) , even during non-symbolic maths tasks. Despite this increased difficulty, they still exhibited no sign of utilizing a logical understanding of the inverse nature of the problem.

They can readily quadruple, quarter, halve, and double the number of objects in a set, and they do so in a variety of scaling combinations. Their performance varied with the ratio of the computed outcome and a comparison array, indicating that this scaling is done in an approximate manner. In both experiments, multiplication transformations were more readily computed than division transformations, and multi-step problems were performed with precision similar to that of single-step multiplication problems. Despite being able to flexibly scale non-symbolic quantities by several multiplicative and divisive factors, children apparently failed to appreciate the conceptual relationship between these two operations and were unable to use the logic of inversion to improve their performance. The finding that performance on two-step problems-in which both multiplication and division transformations were presented-was similar to performance on single-operation problems was unexpected. Multi-step problems require two updates to the quantity representation while it is being transformed, increasing the number of arrays to be represented during problem solving. To our knowledge, there is only a small body of work on the development of combinatorial operations. The majority of these studies are with infants (Baillargeon, 1994; Moher et al., 2012; Piantadosi et al., 2015) and find a lack of prowess in making more than one transformation to a represented object or set of objects. By early childhood this ability appears to be in place: Piantadosi and Aslin (in press) have found that by 4 years of age, children can combine two transformations over an object, and Gilmore and Spelke (2008) established that 5-year-olds were above chance at computing the outcomes to blended addition and subtraction problems. However, operational combinations may come at a cost to children; comparing the datasets of Gilmore and Spelke (2008) to those of Barth et al.

If we had required them to hold each of these amounts in memory simultaneously, then the difference between the conditions would probably be greater (Feigenson & Yamaguchi, 2009; Moher & Feigenson, 2013) . A challenge to this explanation is that the previous work that suggests costly updating during arithmetic (Barth et al., 2006; Gilmore & Spelke, 2008) was also presented serially in a paradigm similar to that of the current experiments. Perhaps the ability to carry out multiple updates here is a result of our slightly older participant pool (7 years of age, compared to 5). Children in the present study also had more practice with single transformations during training than was available in previous work; this may have emphasized that numerical information about the initial array could be discarded in favour of the transformed amount. Future work is needed to determine whether, and how, multiple scaling transformations impact the performance of younger children with less mature updating capacities. For example, a valuable follow-up would be to administer a separate working memory task, such as the Automated Working Memory Assessment (AWMA; Alloway, 2007) . In this way one could examine how the performance difference between single and multiple transformations varies with WM capacity and use an individual differences approach to inform the way we teach alternative or supplemental mathematical strategies to children.",
