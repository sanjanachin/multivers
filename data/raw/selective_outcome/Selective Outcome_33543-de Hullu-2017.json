Methods: In this RCT, moderately socially anxious adolescents (N\u00bc240, mean age 13.6 years) were randomly assigned to a 10-week internet-based multifaceted cognitive bias modification training (CBM), a 10-week school-based cognitive behavioral group training (CBT), or a no-intervention control condition. Using multiple imputation, this study examined the changes in primary and secondary outcome measures from pretest to follow-up in a repeated measures design. Results: Primary outcome: Self-reported social and test anxiety generally decreased from pre-test to two-year follow-up, regardless of treatment condition. The percentage of adolescents who developed a social anxiety disorder was very low (6%) and similar across conditions. Secondary outcome: There were beneficial changes in self-esteem, self-reported prosocial behaviors, and fear of negative evaluation, but none of these were related to treatment condition. Automatic social-threat associations did not significantly change. The CBM intervention was effective in changing interpretative bias as indexed by the Recognition Task but this long-term effect did not transfer to the Adolescent Interpretation and Belief Questionnaire. Limitations: There was a substantial (50%) though seemingly non-selective attrition at follow-up. Conclusions: This RCT does not support the longer-term efficacy of school-based CBT or CBM as an early intervention for social and test anxiety. Rather, it emphasizes the positive 'natural' course of highly socially anxious adolescents over two years.",

Based on a series of recent studies providing evidence that social anxiety can be reduced following successful modification of interpretive bias (Beard & Amir, 2008) or attentional bias (Amir, Beard, Taylor, Klumpp, Elias, Burns et al., 2009) , we tested the efficacy of a 10week internet-delivered Cognitive Bias Modification training (CBM) with a focus on modifying both attentional and interpretive bias as a cost and time-efficient strategy to reduce social and test anxiety.

CBT resulted in a decrease of test anxiety that was still evident at one-year follow-up, whereas the effect of CBM on test anxiety was small and not significant. In addition, CBT resulted in a stronger reduction of social anxiety symptoms than the control condition at six-months follow-up, with a moderate effect size, with a similar tendency for CBM, with a small effect size (Sportel et al., 2013) . Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference between the active conditions relative to the no-treatment control group in reducing social anxiety symptoms at one-year follow-up.",

We used multiple imputation using SPSS 23 software to impute the missing data at the two-year follow-up. Multiple imputation is considered a good strategy for dealing with missing data of incomplete cases, especially when the missingness may not be completely at random (e.g., van Buuren, 2011).

However, the fact that we randomized at school level was not taken into account in the power analyses. It cannot be ruled out that the study was therefore underpowered. Second, it should be acknowledged that a large proportion of the participants (50%) missed one or more of the postintervention assessments. Although pre-test scores were similar for participants who did and those who did not complete all assessments, it cannot be ruled out that there was selective attrition during the follow-up assessments. We did use multiple imputation and the fraction of missing information was thus reduced (ranging from 24 to 38% with a mean of 33%). Third, we excluded adolescents with highly interfering social anxiety disorders. This may have limited the sensitivity of finding treatment gains in the current study. However, the current selection procedure reflects the procedure in many high schools, where schools may offer early interventions to youths with moderate problems, whereas youth with disorders are referred to mental health services. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the current ingredients of the CBM intervention reflect the first generation of CBM interventions. Furthermore, the current CBM combined several components that were designed to address separate cognitive biases. For optimizing CBM it would be important for future research to investigate which components are most effective in modifying the various pertinent cognitive biases (Lau, 2015; Macleod et al., 2015) . Thus, although the current failure to show a reliable effect on the primary outcome measures is in line with recent meta-analyses questioning the efficacy of CBM-procedures as a clinical tool (Cristea, Kok, & Cuijpers, 2015; Cristea, Mogoa\u015fe, David, & Cuijpers, 2015) , it might be premature to conclude that CBM can be discarded as a potentially effective clinical intervention.",

            "The results do not support the use of current CBM procedures as a stand-alone intervention for social and test anxiety, since we found neither short-term (Sportel et al., 2013) nor long-term benefits in terms of a decrease in symptomatology.",
            "The CBT group interventions in schools did provide beneficial effects at 6-and 12-months follow-up (Sportel et al., 2013) , but no additional benefits over a two-year period.",
            "Schools need to consider whether the investment in such a training weighs up to the moderate shortterm benefits and the lack of robust long-term effects."
