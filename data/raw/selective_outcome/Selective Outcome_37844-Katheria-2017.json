Study design Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, third edition, and a standardized neurologic examination. Data regarding pulmonary morbidities, neurosensory impairments, and hospitalizations were obtained by parental interview. Intention-to-treat was used for primary analyses. Results Of the 197 infants enrolled in the original study there were 15 deaths, 5 in the umbilical cord milking group and 10 in DCC group. Of the remaining infants, 135 (74%) were assessed at 22-26 months of corrected age. Demographics in umbilical cord milking (n = 70) and DCC (n = 65) groups were similar. Infants randomized to umbilical cord milking at birth had significantly higher cognitive and language composite scores, and were less likely to have a cognitive composite score of <85 (4% vs 15%; P = .04). Motor function was similar in both groups. There were no differences in the incidences of mild or moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment, hearing or visual impairments, pulmonary morbidities, or rehospitalizations between the 2 groups. Conclusions Infants randomized to umbilical cord milking had higher language and cognitive scores compared with those randomized to DCC. There was no difference in rates of mild or moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment.",

        "text": "The magnitude of improvement in Language composite scores (ie, one-half SD) associated with umbilical cord milking in this study is potentially clinically important. Early childhood language delay is common in preterm children and adversely affects academic performance. Although language improves with age, subtle deficits persist and are associated with differences in brain structure and function. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Although a recent meta-analysis evaluating the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord milking at birth concluded that there was a lower risk for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age compared with early cord clamping, our trial did not demonstrate any differences in short-term or longterm pulmonary morbidity, such as the need for oxygen, bronchodilators, or corticosteroids. 18 A lower risk for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age has not been demonstrated in similar comparisons of early cord clamping vs DCC. 15 Concerns that umbilical cord milking may be deleterious by providing a rapid bolus of blood were not substantiated by either our initial analysis or the current follow-up results. The placental blood flow at 24-29 weeks of gestation is about 8 mL/ second in the umbilical vein, and increases to 10 mL/second (at term). 19 Milking the preterm umbilical cord provides about 18 mL/kg over 2 seconds. 20 In a 1-kg infant, this procedure would provide a similar physiologic infusion of 9 mL/second. Indeed, placental blood during umbilical cord milking is directed toward the lungs during transition from placental respiration to lung respiration when there is a rapid decrease in pulmonary resistance. This phase is unlike any other time when volume might be given. An earlier trial demonstrated no greater increase in venous pressures with umbilical cord milking compared with uterine contractions or a newborn cry during intact placental circulation. 21 Limitations of this study of neurodevelopmental and health outcomes at 22-26 months of CA include the relatively small sample size, the 26% attrition rate, and the reliance on parent recall for medical history and comorbidities. The reasons for the superiority of umbilical cord milking over DCC are unknown with this limited dataset. We acknowledge that, by testing a number of variables, some differences may have occurred by chance alone. Some of these limitations could be overcome by a larger, multicenter trial comparing neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of CA between very preterm infants who receive a placental transfusion via umbilical cord milking or DCC at delivery. Future studies should include long-term neurodevelopment as an outcome measure. \u25a0",
