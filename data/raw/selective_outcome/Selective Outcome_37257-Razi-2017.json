        "text": "Background: The object of this study was to determine whether high doses of inhaled budesonide provide additional benefits to a standardized treatment regimen that includes systemic steroids and salbutamol in preschool patients presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute wheezing attacks. Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial was conducted in children, 6 months-6 years with moderate or severe acute wheezing epizode, as determined based on a pulmonary index score (PIS) of 7-13 points. We compared the addition of budesonide 3 mg versus placebo to standard acute asthma treatment, which included salbutamol and a single 1 mg/kg dose of methylprednisolone given at the beginning of therapy. The primary outcome was differences in hospitalization rates within 4 hr. Secondary outcome was difference in median PIS between treatment groups at 2 hr. Results One hundred patients were enrolled. Cumulative hospitalization rate at 120, 180, and 240 min were 0.72, 0.62, and 0.58 in placebo group; and 0.44, 0.30, and 0.24 in budesonide group. Discharged rate in budesonide group was significantly higher than the placebo group (log-rank \u00bc 12.407 ve P < 0.001). Expected mean discharged times were 200.4 (95%CI \u00bc 185.3-215.5) min in placebo group and 164.4 (95%CI \u00bc 149.4-179.4) min in budesonide group. Median (25-75%) PIS at the 120th min was significantly lower in budesonide group than the placebo group (5 [4-8] vs. 8 [5-9] respectively, P \u00bc 0.006). Conclusions The addition of budesonide nebulization may decrease the admission rate of preschool children who have moderate to severe acute wheezing epizodes.",
