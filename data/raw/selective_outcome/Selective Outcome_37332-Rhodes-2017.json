Objectives-To assess utility of a telephone intervention, implemented through a national primary care pediatric research network, for promoting differentiation in dietary intake, consistent with either a low-glycemic load (Low GL) or Low Fat prescription, among overweight/obese school-age children. Methods-Five-week telephone dietary counseling intervention for parents of overweight/obese school-age children recruited through the Slone Center Office-based Research Network. Parentchild dyads were randomized to Low GL or Low Fat diet. Primary outcomes were dietary GL and dietary fat, adjusted for energy intake and assessed by 24-hour dietary recall. Results-Subjects were randomized to Low GL (n=11, 8.1\u00b11.7 years, 45.5% male) or Low Fat (n=11, 8.2\u00b12.0 years, 36.4% male), with no baseline differences. Overall, 86% of subjects attended at least 4 of 5 counseling sessions, and study completion rate was 91% (based on completion of the final dietary recalls). Reported satisfaction was high. In adjusted analyses limited to \"recall completers,\" reduction in dietary GL (g/1000 Kcal) achieved within the Low GL group was significant (p=0.01) and greater than the change in dietary GL in the Low Fat group (mean \u00b1 SE; \u221212.9 \u00b1 4.4 vs. 5.1 \u00b1 4.9, p=0.03). Similarly, reduction in dietary fat (% of total energy) within the Low Fat group was significant (\u22125.6 \u00b1 2.5, p=0.046) but with no difference between groups (p=0.25).",

Next steps to evaluate broader generalizability of findings must include collaboration with primary care providers who treat ethnically and racially diverse patients and those at all stages of change. Sample size may have limited power to assess changes in primary outcomes. Although we demonstrated a mechanism to conduct dietary trials within a network, our challenges with recruitment, though common (28, 29) , underscore another area for continued planning. In addition, the primary outcome measure was based on dietary assessment and therefore social desirability bias could have influenced our results (30) . Further, while families were not formally masked to group assignment, the interventions were not labeled as \"low-glycemic load\" or \"low fat,\" nor were families aware of the dietary outcomes of interest. Finally, we did not have a control group and thus could not estimate the extent of the effects achieved beyond usual care. Therefore, we cannot compare either intervention effect to changes resulting from external influences. However, given the short duration of the intervention and challenges of obesity treatment, a significant external contribution to observed effects is unlikely.",

            "Strengths of the study include the geographic heterogeneity of the sample, good subject adherence with the protocol, and high retention rate.",
            "Nevertheless, despite sociodemographic heterogeneity in education and income, the sample was predominantly non-Hispanic White and represented families who were ready to change, as a criterion for eligibility, thereby limiting generalizability.",
            "Next steps to evaluate broader generalizability of findings must include collaboration with primary care providers who treat ethnically and racially diverse patients and those at all stages of change.",
            "Sample size may have limited power to assess changes in primary outcomes.",
            "Although we demonstrated a mechanism to conduct dietary trials within a network, our challenges with recruitment, though common (28, 29) , underscore another area for continued planning.",
            "In addition, the primary outcome measure was based on dietary assessment and therefore social desirability bias could have influenced our results (30) .",
            "Further, while families were not formally masked to group assignment, the interventions were not labeled as \"low-glycemic load\" or \"low fat,\" nor were families aware of the dietary outcomes of interest.",
            "Finally, we did not have a control group and thus could not estimate the extent of the effects achieved beyond usual care.",
            "Therefore, we cannot compare either intervention effect to changes resulting from external influences.",
            "However, given the short duration of the intervention and challenges of obesity treatment, a significant external contribution to observed effects is unlikely."
