        "text": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two retainer types (Essix and Hawley) on speech performance. Subjects and methods: The speech articulation of 30 patients was evaluated prospectively. Five patients did not appear during the follow-up periods. The patients were randomly divided into retention groups by treatment allocation cards as Essix and Hawley. The Essix group included 13 participants with a mean age of 15.3 \u00b1 2.4 years; the Hawley group included 12 participants with a mean age of 16.3 \u00b1 2.56 years. Speech sound assessments were performed on the first day and 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months later. On the first day, the assessments were conducted prior to inserting the retainers, immediately after maxillary and mandibular retainer application, individually, and with both retainers applied. The acoustic analyses were obtained using spectral and temporal parameters. Results: Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS for Windows, version 20. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The most apparent changes were found in the [a] vowel in the Hawley group, the [e] vowel in the Essix group, and the [u] vowel in both groups (P < 0.05). While the number of affected consonant-vowel couples in the Essix group was low, alterations were common in the Hawley group. There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in voice onset time of the [d] sound between the groups. Limitations: The trial had a small sample size and a short follow-up period. Conclusions: The Hawley retainer affected articulatory movements in consonant-vowel combinations more prominently than the Essix retainer did. Voice onset time of the consonant [d] in the Hawley group was shorter than normal, indicating rapid articulatory movement in the alveolar region. retainers are acrylic, whereas Essix retainers are vacuum formed. Both appliances fit against the lingual surfaces of the teeth, palate, and lingual mucosa in the maxillary and mandibular arches. Essix retainers were introduced in 1996; since then, their rate of use has increased more than that of Hawley retainers. This is probably due to their improved aesthetics, ease of fabrication, and lower costs (2). Many studies have reported that removable retainers affect speech production (3-7).

Because speech articulation needs rapid, complex, and delicate movements of the articulator organs, it can be affected by dental appliances. Articulatory-acoustic features of speech sounds may be a useful instrument for assessing articulation proficiency (9) . One of the most important analysed acoustic characteristic of vowels is called formant frequency. Formant frequencies can be used as indexes of front-back or low-high dimensions of lingual function (10) . As a general rule, First Formant Frequency (F1) is related to tongue height, Second Formant Frequency (F2) is related to tongue advancement and lip rounding, and Third Formant Frequency (F3) is related more to the back oral cavity (10) . The articulatory-acoustic relationship is also important in consonant production. When producing stop consonants, articulators create a brief constriction. Air pressure builds up behind this constriction, and it is released from the mouth by sudden movement of the articulators. The shape, timing, and degree of this constriction lead to the occurrence of some acoustic events. One of those events is called 'voice onset time' (VOT) (11) . VOT measurements provide information regarding the temporal relationship between the onset of glottal pulsing and the release of the initial stop consonant (11) (12) (13) . VOT also helps to differentiate between voiced and voiceless stops (11, 14) .",
