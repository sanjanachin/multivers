Due to a lack of evidence to support the ND, there continues to be debate among pediatric oncologists regarding its usefulness. This prospective randomized controlled trial evaluated the difference in neutropenic infection rates in pediatric oncology patients randomized to Food and Drug Administration approved food safety guidelines (FSGs) versus the ND plus FSGs during one cycle of chemotherapy. Procedure: Pediatric patients receiving cancer treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy were eligible. Neutropenic infection was the primary outcome and defined as (i) fever with neutropenia or (ii) hospital admission and treatment for clinical infection and neutropenia. The rate of neutropenic infection was compared with Student's t-test for independent samples. Documented infections were identified by comprehensive chart review and compared between groups using a 2 test. Results: : One hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned to FSGs (n = 73) or ND + FSGs (n = 77). The most common diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (32%) and sarcoma (32%). There was no significant difference between the groups in the percentage of patients who developed neutropenic infection: FSGs 33% versus ND + FSGs 35% (P = 0.78). Patients randomized to ND + FSGs reported that following the diet required more effort than those on FSGs alone. Conclusion: The ND offers no benefit over FSGs in the prevention of infection in pediatric oncology patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy and adherence requires more effort for patients and families. Institutions caring for children with cancer should consider replacing ND guidelines with FSGs.",

The majority of these infections are a result of the patients' own microbiota. 3 Notably, the gut microbiome is involved in protecting a host from infection due to harmful bacteria. However, little is known about how to impact the gut microbiome via diet in children with cancer to reduce the incidence of infection. 4, 5 It is understood that patients with cancer can experience dysbiosis, or an unhealthy imbalance between potentially beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, due to exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and certain antineoplastic agents, as well as changes in gut motility and integrity. 6 These patients may be at increased risk for neutropenic infections, particularly neutropenic colitis, 6 especially in combination with mucositis. Mucositis and neutropenia are the main risk factors for bacterial translocation from the gut to the bloodstream. 7 In an effort to reduce the incidence of infections in neutropenic patients, a low bacteria diet, also known as the neutropenic diet (ND), was conceived to reduce the introduction of bacteria into the gut. 8, 9 Greater than 90% of NDs restrict the consumption of fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and fruit juices; however, there exists no standard definition of the ND. 10 Despite widespread recommendations for the ND by pediatric oncologists, there are, to date, no clinically relevant data to support the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce infection in children with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
