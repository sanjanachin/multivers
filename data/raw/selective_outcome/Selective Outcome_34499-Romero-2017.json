More than 95% of VL reported cases in Latin America occur in Brazil, with more than 40% of those in children under 10 years of age [3, 4] . In Brazil, the disease has spread from the rural North East region throughout the national territory over the past 30 years, causing epidemics in the fast-growing outskirts of many large and medium-sized cities [5] . Between 1990 and 2014, Brazil reported a total of 78,433 cases, with an average of 3,137 new cases per year [6] . Recent studies have demonstrated increasing case-fatality rates [7] and poor prognosis has been associated with the presence of jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and age >40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea and bacterial infections [8] . In Brazil, the current first-line treatment for VL is meglumine antimoniate-MA (20 mg Sb +5 /kg/day for 20 days), with amphotericin B deoxycholate-AmphoB (1 mg/kg/day for 14 days) or liposomal amphotericin B-LAMB (3 mg/kg/day for 7 days) being second-line treatments [5] . However, there is no local evidence on the efficacy and safety of these recommended treatment regimens [9] . The national treatment recommendations are based on an expert consensus based on data obtained from studies carried out in other VL-endemic geographies (e.g. Europe, Asia) and local medical practice. As recommended treatments present serious patient management limitations due to toxicity, a need for parenteral administration and hospitalization, the risk of resistance development, and cost, alternative drugs and treatment regimens for VL are needed. Although a series of new, highly active compounds have been identified, these are still in pre-clinical or earlier phases of development. In the short term, organizations such as the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) have adopted a strategy of investigating combination therapies in order to improve current treatment regimens. Clinical trials conducted on the Indian subcontinent and in Africa have shown the efficacy and safety of different treatment combinations: sodium stibogluconate (SSG) plus paromomycin (PM) in East Africa [10] , and LAMB plus miltefosine, LAMB plus PM and miltefosine plus PM in India [11] .",

Although, based on the current medical practice in Brazil, a maximum daily dose of antimony was used to avoid toxicity, the upper limit dose would not have significantly impacted trial outcome due to the overwhelming proportion of pediatric participants in the study. The LAMB regimen was selected due to the limited data available for Brazil [16] and the encouraging results obtained by Sundar et al. (2010) in India [17] .
