        "text": "Introduction: Bystander-based programs have shown promise to reduce interpersonal violence at colleges, yet limited rigorous evaluations have addressed bystander intervention effectiveness in high schools. This study evaluated the Green Dot bystander intervention to reduce sexual violence and related forms of interpersonal violence in 26 high schools over 5 years. Design: A cluster RCT was conducted. Setting/participants: Kentucky high schools were randomized to intervention or control (wait list) conditions. Intervention: Green Dot\u00c0trained educators conducted schoolwide presentations and recruited student popular opinion leaders to receive bystander training in intervention schools beginning in Year 1. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was sexual violence perpetration, and related forms of interpersonal violence victimization and perpetration were also measured using anonymous student surveys collected at baseline and annually from 2010 to 2014. Because the school was the unit of analysis, violence measures were aggregated by school and year and schoollevel counts were provided. Results: A total of 89,707 students completed surveys. The primary, as randomized, analyses conducted in 2014-2016 included linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations to examine the condition\u00c0time interaction on violence outcomes. Slopes of school-level totals of sexual violence perpetration (condition\u00c0time, po0.001) and victimization (condition\u00c0time, po0.001) were different over time. During Years 3-4, when Green Dot was fully implemented, the mean number of sexual violent events prevented by the intervention was 120 in Intervention Year 3 and 88 in Year 4. For Year 3, prevalence rate ratios for sexual violence perpetration in the intervention relative to control schools were 0.83 (95% CI\u00bc0.70, 0.99) in Year 3 and 0.79 (95% CI\u00bc0.67, 0.94) in Year 4. Similar patterns were observed for sexual violence victimization, sexual harassment, stalking, and dating violence perpetration and victimization. Conclusions: Implementation of Green Dot in Kentucky high schools significantly decreased not only sexual violence perpetration but also other forms of interpersonal violence perpetration and victimization.",

        "text": "The Green Dot violence prevention program (www.livethegreen dot.com) aims to engage potential bystanders to act to reduce sexual violence and related forms of interpersonal violence. 8, 13 This program is theory-based and supported by research drawing from bystander psychology, [20] [21] [22] [23] diffusion of innovation theory, 24, 25 and sexual violence perpetrator characteristics. [26] [27] [28] Male and female students are trained to recognize situations and behaviors that can contribute to violence and determine actions they could safely take to reduce the likelihood or effect of violence. These active bystander behaviors are called \"green dots\" to distinguish them from \"red dots\" or behaviors that may contribute to violence. Although originally developed for college students, for this trial, the developer adapted the program for high school\u00c0aged populations. 18 This adapted curriculum was delivered in two phases by trained rape crisis center educators (hereafter \"educators\"; n=28 educators; all female). Intervention training began Fall 2010 (beginning Year 1 [Y1]), with the majority (450%) of students in intervention schools receiving a 50-minute introductory persuasive speech delivered by educators (Phase 1). This schoolwide presentation oriented students to their potential role as engaged bystanders and explained how to recognize \"red dots\" and \"green dots.\" Green Dot speeches were provided annually to students in the intervention schools. Phase 2 was implemented beginning Spring 2011 (Y2) using the popular opinion leader strategy, 29, 30 which suggests that training 12%\u00c015% of a student body would maximize diffusion of the intervention. Educators worked with high school staff to identify students as leaders. Leadership qualities were operationalized as students others respected, followed, or emulated and not necessarily those with academic, athletic, or social leadership skills. These students were invited to participate in intensive (5-hour) bystander training. If space permitted, this training was also open for other students. Both training phases focused on violence victimization, perpetration, and on prosocial behaviors to recognize situations that may lead to violence and to act directly to distract or to delegate to others tasks to reduce the likelihood of violence (three Ds). Training focused not only on sexual violence risk but on sexual harassment, stalking, and partner violence.",

Repeated school-level measures were analyzed over time, where schools, not students, were the unit of analysis.

Significant CxT interactions indicated intervention effectiveness to reduce sexual violence perpetration, victimization, and other forms of interpersonal violence over time. A time delay between intervention implementation and reductions in violent behavior was anticipated, as the intervention was hypothesized to reduce violence at the school level by first changing individual-level social norms supporting violence and increasing bystander skills and actions among the subset of trained individuals. Changes at the individual level in norms and behaviors require time to ultimately be detected as changes in violence at the school level. From secondary analyses, the intervention was effective in reducing the student-level violence perpetration rates by 17%\u00c021% (po0.01) in Y3 and Y4. This study is the first RCT of a bystander intervention focusing on sexual violence prevention and implemented with both sexes in a high school setting. This intervention is unique in its use of a gender-neutral approach to engage and train bystanders. The popular opinion leader model for recruitment and training may be a particularly efficient method to diffuse prosocial, non-violent norms through students' peer networks and change violence rates. Cost efficiencies of providing an intervention to only 12%\u00c015% of students using this training strategy, yet finding a 17%\u00c021% reduction in sexual violence, as observed here, may be particularly attractive for policymakers and school administrators because prevention programs that effectively address multiple violence forms may be particularly efficient strategies, given schools' multiple educational objectives. 19 The present finding that Green Dot was associated with a significant reduction in high school\u00c0level reports of using alcohol-or drug-facilitated sex was consistent with a recently reported observational study of a similar intervention among college freshmen. 34 Unwanted sex was significantly lower (po0.05) on the campus receiving a bystander program compared with two campuses without a bystander program (adjusted rate ratio, 0.75), with the largest reduction for alcohol-or drug-facilitated sexual violence (adjusted rate ratio, 0.64, po0.001). The intervention campus also had significantly lower rates of sexual harassment, stalking, and psychological dating violence. 35 The only other rigorous evaluation of a bystander prevention strategy among high school students 35 focused on violence perpetration in dating situations (including sexual violence against a partner). The current design and dating violence findings were similar to that reported by Miller et al., 35 who observed a reduction in self-reported physical dating violence perpetration associated with this intervention over time among male athletes. The studies differed in that other forms of interpersonal violence perpetration and victimization were measured and both young women and men were the target of this intervention. Other evidence-based programs [36] [37] [38] [39] set in middle or high schools have relied on different strategies to reduce sexual violence, such as teaching skills for building healthy relationships, changing violence acceptance, or implementing in-school protective orders and hot spot mapping.",
