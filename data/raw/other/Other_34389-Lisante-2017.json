The OTC oatmeal cream was as effective as prescription barrier cream for the treatment of signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate AD in children. At week 3, there was a clinical improvement in AD in both treatment groups based on the changes from baseline in EASI scores. Primary efficacy analysis of the changes from baseline in EASI scores at week 3 for both treatment groups showed that the 95% CIs of the treatment difference were within the non-inferiority margin. The improvement in EASI scores in both treatment groups during the study period was comparable. While there was no significant difference in the VAS itch score at week 3 between treatment groups, there was a small increase in itch reported at each follow-up time point, which was unexpected. This increase was present at each time point when compared to baseline. Previous studies on colloidal oat formulas have shown a decrease in itch ITT: intent-to-treat; OTC: over-the-counter; SE: standard error; SD: standard deviation; VAS: visual analog scale. scores over time. Further review of the materials provided to the patients to assess itch uncovered an inconsistency in the questions assessing itch, which may have confused the patient. The itch assessment instructions given on the Case Report Form were \"Rate the intensity of your itch\" and patients were asked to choose a number between 0 (no itch) and 10 (worst itch imaginable). Shortly after completing this assessment, at the same visit, subjects were asked to complete a QoL questionnaire. The QoL questionnaire included the question \"How would you rate the itch of your/your child's skin (if any)?\" The numerical anchors provided in the assessment for this question were similar (1 through 10); however, 1 indicated very itchy and 10 indicated not itchy at all. It may have been an oversight by the sponsor to include such closely related questions with opposite anchors for assessment, particularly when administered at the same visit. Of note, the scores for itch collected with the QoL questionnaire indicated a definite improvement over baseline for both groups. Similarly, an improvement in IGADA scores during the study period was observed. Both study treatments were well tolerated and no safety issues were identified.

Preclinical studies have shown that colloidal oatmeal has multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory, antihistaminic, and antipruritic effects (10, 22, 28) . Furthermore, it is recognized as a non-pharmaceutical, FDA-approved product with an excellent safety profile and may represent an alternative or adjunctive therapy for patients with dermatoses (e.g. AD) that require corticosteroid or calcineurin-inhibitor treatment. For these reasons, colloidal oatmeal products are being increasingly prescribed by physicians for maintenance treatment of conditions such as AD (12) .",
