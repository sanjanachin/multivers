Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (n \u00bc 728 households, n \u00bc 106 communities). We conducted intent-to-treat analyses and examined the interaction between treatment group and mother's age at first birth. The primary outcomes were parenting behaviors (Family Care Indicators) and children's cognitive development (McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities) at ages 3e5 years. Results: We found that children of mothers who began childbearing in adulthood (20e30 years) scored higher on tests of cognitive development when randomized to weekly parenting support than their counterparts in the comparison group. Whereas, the children of mothers who began childbearing in adolescence (16 years) did not have higher scores associated with the parenting program (difference in magnitude of associations: Verbal \u00bc \u00c08.19; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c015.50 to \u00c0.88; p \u00bc .03; Memory \u00bc \u00c07.22; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c014.31 to \u00c0.14; p \u00bc .05). The higher scores among the children of mothers who began childbearing in adulthood were only significant when Educaci\u00f3n Inical was supported by Prospera, the conditional cash transfer program. Conclusions: Our study results suggest that the Educaci\u00f3n Inicial parenting intervention did not adequately address the needs of women who began childbearing in adolescence. One reason may be that adolescent mothers are more socially marginalized and less able to benefit from parenting programs.",

The higher scores among the children of mothers who began childbearing in adulthood were only significant when EI was supported by Prospera, the conditional cash transfer program. Table 2 Comparison of baseline characteristics across the three treatment arms in the follow-up sample in 2012 (N \u00bc 728) When EI was not supported by Prospera, our results suggested that being in EI was associated with worse parenting behaviors and reduced cognitive development among mothers who began childbearing in early adolescence and their children. This finding, however, was tempered by a nonsignificant difference in associations between early adolescent and adult mothers and a reverse association among late adolescent mothers on the FCI. The differences in cognitive development scores comparing children in T 2 to children in T 0 in the previous evaluation of EI (SD \u00bc .25 on the General Cognitive Index) were within the range of those observed here. The effect sizes for the children of women who began childbearing later in life (SD \u00bc .40e.45) were larger than the effect sizes for other home visiting and groupbased parenting programs with similar aims [30, 31] . However, other programs produced larger effect sizes [32, 33] . The effect sizes among the children of women who began childbearing in early adolescence were quite low, and even negative. The previous evaluation also showed that T 1 was not associated with improvements in cognitive development and parenting behaviors compared with T 0 [20] . The authors hypothesized that this was due to differences in participation rates resulting from the additional efforts of Prospera promotoras.",

These women may also rely more on their own parents or parents-in-law, who may not be attending EI, to largely take over child-rearing responsibilities.
