        "text": "In the present analysis, the number of patients with CRs was higher in the 20 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron group across all phases and all four onstudy chemotherapy cycles compared with those treated in the ondansetron group. In particular, Mantel-Haenszel analysis of data from the second on-study chemotherapy cycle was consistent with the previously reported formal demonstration of the noninferiority of 20 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron compared with ondansetron in the acute phase of the first on-study chemotherapy cycle. The proportion of patients with no vomiting, no emetic episodes and with no use for antiemetic rescue medication across on-study chemotherapy cycles 1-4 and during all phases was also higher in patients in the 20 \u03bcg/kg compared with the ondansetron group (except for no use for antiemetic rescue medication in the acute phases of on-study cycles 1 and 2). As previously reported for the delayed phase of cycle 1 [17] , the 95% CI calculated for the difference in the proportion of patients experiencing no emetic episodes in the 20 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron and ondansetron groups (\u0394 15.38% [95% CI: 5.1-25.7]) did not include a zero value, indicating that the efficacy of this dose of palonosetron during this phase might be superior to that of ondansetron. Furthermore, in adult cancer patients, older class setron agents when used in recommended doses were not as efficacious as palonosetron in the control of delayed emesis [24] [25] [26] . Controlling delayed emesis remains an unmet clinical need [27] , and palonosetron might, therefore, provide much needed relief to pediatric cancer patients for up to 5 days following multicycle emetic chemotherapy, often following discharge from hospital. Interpretation of the multicycle data, however, should be treated with some caution due to the small number of patients in some of the treatment groups and strata, particularly in later chemotherapy cycles. This was mainly due to the expected high rate of patients not continuing with each subsequent cycle, thus analysis using stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel was not possible in on-study chemotherapy cycles 3 and 4. In addition, in general in multicycle studies, the patients responding best to treatments tend to remain in the study for a higher number of cycles; this may be considered as a potential source of bias. The inclusion of patients scheduled to receive multiple day (day 1 and additional days) chemotherapy also complicates the interpretation of outcome in the delayed and overall phases. However, given that many pediatric chemotherapy regimens are multiple day, this was deemed to be necessary at the time of study design to ensure that sufficient patients could be enrolled to allow for the evaluation of efficacy. The chosen model of randomization and double blinding minimizes the impact of this limitation when comparing treatment groups. A further limitation is that the assessment of the efficacy during the delayed phase of cycles 2-4 was based on questions to the patient 120 h after the start of the chemotherapy, so the patient had to remember if she or he had experienced vomiting/retching/nausea over the last 4 days. Because the assessment of vomiting and retching was performed differently in cycles 2-4 compared with cycle 1, the efficacy should be analyzed by cycle comparing the treatment groups. The comparison of treatment between cycle 1 and the other cycles could be subject to recall bias issues. The safety profile across all four chemotherapy cycles was as to be expected for patients receiving MEC and HEC. The most commonly reported TEAEs over four cycles of chemotherapy included MedDRA preferred terms listed under the SOC blood and lymphatic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and general disorders and administration site conditions. Progression into subsequent on-study chemotherapy cycles did not appear to induce worsening of TEAEs in any SOC. No clinically relevant differences were reported between patients treated with 10 or 20 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron (with no incremental toxicity evident) or ondansetron. However, we note that fewer patients receiving 20 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron had grade \u22653 TEAEs in on-study chemotherapy cycles 1-4 than those in the 10 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron and ondansetron groups. The overall frequency of TEAEs considered to be related to treatment was low in the palonosetron 10 \u03bcg/kg (9 [(5.4%] of 167 patients), 20 \u03bcg/kg (8 [4.9%] of 163 patients) and ondansetron (10 [6.1%] of 164 patients) groups, and all were reported during on-study chemotherapy cycles 1 and 2. Nervous system disorders (headache, dizziness and dyskinesia) were the most commonly reported adverse events related to treatment. Older class 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are reportedly associated with a risk of inducing adverse cardiac events (electrocardiogram changes and arrhythmias), although studies suggest palonosetron to be less of a risk for these events [10, 28, 29] . In total, treatment-related cardiac disorders were reported in one patient receiving 10 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron and two receiving ondansetron. Treatment-related prolonged electrocardiogram QT was reported in one patient receiving 20 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron and two treated with ondansetron. Discontinuations associated with TEAEs, and TEAEs with a fatal outcome were not considered to be treatment related.",
