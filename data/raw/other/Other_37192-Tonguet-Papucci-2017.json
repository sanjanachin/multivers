However, quantitative data on the impact of cash transfer programs on children\u00d5s energy and nutrient intakes are lacking. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of seasonal unconditional cash transfers on children\u00d5s energy, micro-and macronutrient, and food group intakes during the lean season in Burkina Faso. Methods: Within the framework of the MAM\u00d5Out (Moderate Acute Malnutrition Out) cluster-randomized controlled trial, two 24-h dietary recall surveys were conducted in July and August 2014. Daily energy and macro-and micronutrient intakes, breastfeeding practices, and food group consumption were analyzed for 322 children aged 14-27 mo from an intervention group (benefiting from unconditional cash transfer during the lean season in 2013 and 2014) and a control group by using mixed linear, logistic, and Poisson regression models or a g-generalized linear model with log-link. A dietary diversity score was calculated on the basis of 7 food groups. Results: Unconditional cash transfers during the lean season improved the diets of rural children through a higher",

The 24-h dietary recalls were implemented in the framework of a clusterrandomized controlled trial and took advantage of its strong design. All of the basic characteristics of the intervention and control groups, including height-for-age z score, were comparable, except for the slightly lower mean weight-for-height z score of children in the control group. However, because adjusting the analyses for nutritional status and breastfeeding practices, which may both have changed as a result of the cash transfer program, holds a risk of bias, we did not adjust the analyses for these 2 factors. The 1-wk training the data collectors underwent on the 24-h food recall methodology allowed for the standardization and pretesting of the method of data collection. In addition, the 2-mo period of data collection was supervised: every week, 2 of the children visited by each data collector were visited a second time by the supervisor to check on the data collected. A number of study limitations also need to be addressed. First, we were unable to adjust analyses for data collectors, due to an error during data entry. Collector bias was nevertheless limited by the fact that 2 different data collectors systematically conducted the 2 recalls in the same household. Second, the 6 clusters excluded from data collection due to difficult access may have had a higher prevalence of acute malnutrition than those that were included. The effect of the intervention might also have been lower in these villages due to limited access to the market. Third, two-thirds of the children in the study were still breastfed at the time of the evaluation. To our knowledge, no precise technique to evaluate the quantity of milk consumed by children is currently available, beyond weighing the child before and after breastfeeding or giving isotopic labeled water to mothers. In the MAM\u00d5Out study area, it was not possible to use either of these techniques due to operational constraints. We tried to overcome this problem by designing a detailed questionnaire on breastfeeding practices to estimate the number of times a child was breastfed during the day and the corresponding duration, but this was still not sufficient to estimate energy intake from breast milk. One possible solution would have been to hypothesize average breast milk intake as has been done in previous studies (34) . However, this is still an estimation and does not measure the breast-milk intake precisely. Because the same estimation method was used in both groups, we assume that the measurement error was similar for the 2 groups. Fourth, we did not adjust our analyses for multiple hypothesis testing. Although this is still an ongoing debate (35) , concerns may be raised about the need to re-evaluate the P values used for the significance of the results, which may decrease the number of significant differences we found between groups. However, the results presented here tend to go in the same direction (with a higher number of children consuming animal products in the intervention group, more egg intake in term of quantities, and more vitamin B-12 intake), which strengthens confidence in them (35) . Finally, no measurement of body composition or biomarkers before or after the intervention was performed. As such, it is hard to observe the direct health benefits of the intervention. However, our results show, first, that unrestricted and unconditional cash was used for food purposes and allowed improvement in children\u00d5s diet quality. Yet, the amount distributed may have been too low with respect to family size to have a positive effect on children\u00d5s health via an improved diet quality.",
