Methods The clinical trial was undertaken in the neonatal intensive care unit of JIPMER during the time period from September 2013 through December 2016. Neonates with clinical manifestations of sepsis who exhibited two positive screening tests (microESR, C-reactive protein, band cell count) were included and randomized into no zinc and zinc group. The intervention was zinc sulfate monohydrate given at a dose of 3 mg/kg twice a day orally for 10 d along with standard antibiotics. The no zinc group was on antibiotic treatment. Blood samples from both groups were collected at baseline and after day 10. Babies were carefully discharged from the hospital. The babies were followed up till 12 mo corrected age using DASII (Development Assessment Scale for Indian Infants). Results At the time of enrolment, patient characteristics were similar in both the groups. The mortality rate was significantly higher in no zinc compared to zinc group (5 vs. 13; P = 0.04). Although motor development quotient was similar, mental development quotient was significantly better among babies who received zinc supplementation. Conclusions Short term zinc supplementation of newborns with sepsis reduces mortality and improves mental development quotient at 12 mo of age.",
