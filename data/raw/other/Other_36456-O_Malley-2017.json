This study explored whether the GAA 15, a multifaceted 8-week neuromuscular training program could improve risk factors for lower limb injury in male Gaelic footballers and hurlers. Four Gaelic sports collegiate teams were randomized into intervention or control groups. Two teams, one football, one hurling, (n=41), were allocated to the intervention, undertaking a 15 minute program of neuromuscular training exercises at the start of team training sessions, twice weekly for 8 weeks. Two matched teams (n=37) acted as controls, participating in usual team training. Lower extremity stability (Y-Balance Test) and jump-landing technique using Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) were assessed pre and post intervention. There were moderate effect sizes in favour of the intervention for right (d=0.59) and left (d=0.69) composite YBT scores, with adjusted mean differences between intervention and control of 3.85 \u00b10.91% and 4.34\u00b10.92% for right and left legs respectively (p<0.001). There was a greater reduction in mean LESS score in favour of the intervention group post exercise training (Cohen's d= 0.72, adjusted mean difference 2.49\u00b10.54, p<0.001). Clinically and statistically significant improvements in dynamic balance and jump-landing technique occurred in collegiate level Gaelic football and hurling players who adopted the GAA 15, when compared to usual training. These findings support application and evaluation of the GAA 15 in other player groups within the Gaelic games playing population.",
