Methods We conducted a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial in seven Italian centres comparing two different doses of ATLG (30 mg/kg vs 15 mg/kg, given intravenously over 3 days, from day-4 to-2) in children (aged 0-18 years) with haematological malignancies transplanted from an unrelated donor, selected using high-resolution typing for HLA-class I/II loci. All patients received a myeloablative regimen and cyclosporine-A plus short-term methotrexate as post-transplantation GVHD prophylaxis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either of the two groups and were stratified by the degree of HLA-compatibility with their donor, the source of haemopoietic stem cells used (bone marrow vs peripheral blood stem cells), and the disease risk category. The randomisation was open label; all investigators were aware of the treatment allocation. The primary endpoint of the study was 100-day cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD. Statistical analyses were done according to the per-protocol principle. Other outcomes included cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD, non-relapse mortality, disease recurrence, and probability of overall survival and event-free survival.

GVHD is associated with an increased risk of non-relapse mortality and a reduction in quality of life. [1] [2] [3] Anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATLG) has been widely used for prevention of acute and chronic GVHD in patients given allogeneic HSCT. In the past few years, different groups have shown in randomised clinical trials that the addition of ATLG to GVHD prophylaxis decreases the risk of both acute and chronic GVHD in adults receiving either HSCT from an unrelated donor [4] [5] [6] [7] or peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling. 8 However, recent findings have suggested that treatment with ATLG could increase the risk of relapse and infections, potentially hampering the benefits of improved GVHD prevention. 9 In fact, ATLG administration has been shown to be associated with delayed T-cell reconstitution, including that of naive and memory T lymphocytes, and with an increased risk of infectious complications and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. [10] [11] [12] Rabbit ATLG is the preferred agent for approaches of GVHD prevention through serotherapy in HSCT. However, two diverse rabbit ATLG preparations are available for clinical use in patients given allogeneic HSCT, which can have different effects on outcome and markedly different efficacies because their different preparation methods cause them to differ substantially in potency and dosing. 13 None of the previously published trials has focused on a paediatric population. We hypothesised that fine tuning of GVHD prophylaxis and, particularly, of the dose of ATLG administered before allogeneic unrelated donor HSCT, could have an important role in the outcome of paediatric patients. To try to define the better dose of rabbit ATLG, we did a prospective, multicentre, clinical trial comparing two different doses of the drug (15 mg/kg vs 30 mg/kg) in children affected by haematological malignancies transplanted with either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells from an unrelated donor selected using high-resolution molecular typing for class I and II HLA loci. We chose to compare 30 mg/kg versus 15 mg/kg of ATLG instead of the dose of 60 mg/kg used in unrelated donor HSCT recipients in the trial published by Finke and colleagues 6 because children are less prone to developing GVHD compared to adults. 3, 14 This choice is supported by a retrospective analysis showing that 30 mg/kg of ATLG in a single dose was as effective for the prevention of GVHD as 60 mg/kg administered over 3 days in adults with haematological malignancies given HSCT from an unrelated volunteer. 15 In that trial, the 2-year non-relapse mortality was lower for the ATLG 30 mg/kg group than",

Despite these limitations and the choice of administering ATLG in an open-label manner, we found that children given 30 mg/kg ATLG had a higher incidence of infection-related deaths than children given the 15 mg/kg dose (seven deaths vs three); moreover, the children given 30 mg/kg ATLG also had an increased risk of adenovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections. Although we do not have data on virus-specific immune reconstitution in the two groups, several studies 11, 26 have reported that ATLG has a half-life of 7-14 days, which means that patients are exposed to ATLG both before and after HSCT, and substantial evidence exists that higher doses of ATLG are associated with slower recovery of pathogen-specific immunity and higher incidence of fatal infections. 4, 9, 10, 12 Among patients undergoing HSCT, adenovirus infections have a much higher prevalence in paediatric patients (20-26%) than in adults (9%), possibly because of the reservoir of adenovirus in the general paediatric population. 27, 28 The high doses of ATLG depleting antiviral T cells transferred with the graft due to the long half-life of the polyclonal antibodies could have a detrimental effect on recovery of pathogen-specific T-cell immunity, which was shown to be crucial for clearing the viral infection and preventing dissemination of adenovirus infection. 27 Previous reports have also documented that both T-cell depletion and high rabbit ATLG serum concentrations on day 7 after HSCT are associated with increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus infection and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders. 29, 30 Among children given 30 mg/kg ATLG in our study, one child of the two developing posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders died from this complication. Notably, a study 31 published in 2017 showed that detection of multiple double-stranded DNA viruses has a dose-dependent association with increased mortality after HSCT. 31 The use of 15 mg/kg ATLG was associated with statistically improved event-free survival in the subgroups of children with acute leukaemia or with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which represents the more frequent indication for an allograft in haematological malignancies of childhood. The 78% probability of eventfree survival at 5 years reported in the 50 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia given 15 mg/kg ATLG compares favourably to the results reported by Peters and colleagues 25 in 306 children transplanted from an unrelated donor with a standardised transplantation and GVHD prophylaxis protocol (71% at 4 years).",
