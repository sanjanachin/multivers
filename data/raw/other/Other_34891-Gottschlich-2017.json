Moreover, unlike our prior work demonstrating that D 2 administration resulted in lower D25 compared with no supplementation, 3 it appears from the current study that D 2 (as well as D 3 ) was effective in preventing D25 decline during acute care, presumably due to the provision of 800 IU D 3 per liter of tube feeding since similar findings were evident in the placebo group. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] We found D 3 supplementation during hospitalization to slow deterioration in serum D25 concentration postdischarge, as evidenced by the fact that only 25% of those supplemented with D 3 had below-normal levels 1 year later, as opposed to a 75% and 56% incidence of hypovitaminosis D in . Discharge and 1-year D1,25 were higher than baseline (P < .0001). Significant increases were also evident from midpoint to discharge (P = .02) and 1 year (P = .0002). To convert D1,25 pg/mL to pmol/L, multiply by 2.40. . Midpoint and discharge levels were lower than baseline and 1 year (P = .0001). To convert PTH pg/mL to pmol/L, multiply by 0.1061. In an effort to ensure that minimum requirements were addressed, all 3 treatment groups (including placebo) received 800 IU D 3 per liter of tube feeding daily (in addition to the investigational product). Selection of enteral D 3 as the standardized substrate for routine clinical care was justified by our earlier findings that D 2 supplementation practices (approximately twice the Dietary Reference Intake) did not prevent hypovitaminosis D. In an effort to strengthen the likelihood of achieving statistical differences, it could be argued that the placebo group should have received lower, basal amounts, but given deficiency preponderance postburn, we felt that using vitamin D guidelines established for conditions of health would not be appropriate during injury. Several factors were considered when establishing the dosage of the vitamin D study intervention (100 IU/kg/d) to supplement that contained in the tube feeding regimen (800 IU/L). For one thing, the study sample comprised critically ill children who required careful monitoring and adjustment of electrolytes, including those affected by vitamin D and PTH (eg, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium). We did not want to contribute to electrolyte derangements precipitated by vitamin D toxicity. Also well thought out was projected total vitamin intake (eg, tube feeding plus extra dose in study supplement), again to avoid potential toxicity from daily supplement over time. Projected total vitamin D intake, estimated at 2000-15,000 IU daily (depending on age, weight, and burn size), was regarded to be a fairly robust daily intake. Some may argue that a higher dose might have achieved improved efficacy, but we speculate this might not have occurred given that the placebo group had 25-OH-D 3 levels similar to the D 3 -supplemented group. Finally, our prior work 3 demonstrating a negative correlation of D 2 supplementation and D25 levels was further cause to refrain from an overzealous vitamin D protocol.",
