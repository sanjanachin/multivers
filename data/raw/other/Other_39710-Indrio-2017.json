Newborn were randomly allocated during the first 48 h of life to receive either daily probiotic (10 8 colony forming units (CFUs) of L. reuteri DSM 17938) or placebo for one month. All the newborns underwent to gastric ultrasound for the measurement of gastric emptying time. Fecal samples were collected for the evaluation of fecal cytokines. Clinical data on feeding intolerance and weight gain were collected. The costs of hospital stays were calculated. The results showed that the newborns receiving L. reuteri DSM 17938 had a significant decrease in the number of days needed to reach full enteral feeding (p < 0.01), days of hospital stay (p < 0.01), and days of antibiotic treatment (p < 0.01). Statistically significant differences were observed in pattern of fecal cytokine profiles. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, was increased in newborns receiving L. reuteri DSM 17938. Pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-17, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels were increased in newborns given placebo. Differences in the gastric emptying and fasting antral area (FAA) were also observed. Our study demonstrates an effective role for L. reuteri DSM 17938 supplementation in preventing feeding intolerance and improving gut motor and immune function development in bottle-fed stable preterm newborns.

        "text": "During the third trimester of pregnancy and in the first days after birth, important processes of intestinal maturation take place. Although anatomical differentiation of the human gut is usually achieved within 20 weeks of gestation, the functional maturation of the gastrointestinal tract occurs later and requires organized peristalsis and coordinated sucking and swallowing reflexes that are not established until 29-30 weeks and 32-34 weeks of gestations, respectively [1] . Sensory-motor gastrointestinal functions are strictly related to the infant's immune system, which plays a crucial role in modulating appropriate and non-exaggerated responses to luminal antigens. This fundamental enteric function, known as \"oral tolerance\" is based on the interaction between the luminal content (microbiota, food antigens, and other molecules), the intestinal epithelium, and the tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) from mesenteric lymph nodes of the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) [2] , and is associated with specific cytokine patterns. It has been suggested that the early composition of the intestinal microbiota at birth can influence the correct ontogenesis of the gut barrier, and motor and immune function through a complex neuroendocrine cross-talk [3, 4] . Consequences of prematurity like antibiotic usage, feeding type, and being located in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may cause an intestinal dysbiosis that affects the intestinal integrity and disrupts the delicate balance between intestinal microbiota and the immune system of premature infants. An aberrant microbial colonization pattern might contribute to the development of an early traumatic inflammatory insult on the gut-brain axis with short-and long-term consequences on gastrointestinal well-being [5] .",
