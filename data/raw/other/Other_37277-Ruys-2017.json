        "text": "Background: Early nutritional interventions may modulate health risks in preterm-born infants. Previously, we showed that pretermborn infants fed an isocaloric protein-and mineral-enriched postdischarge formula (PDF) from term age to 6-mo corrected age (CA) gained more lean mass than did those fed term formula (TF). Longterm follow-up of randomized nutritional trials is important to test the hypothesis that short-term positive effects on health are sustainable. Objective: The aim of this follow-up study was to compare body size, body composition, and metabolic health at age 8 y in pretermborn children who were randomly assigned to receive either PDF or TF from term age until 6-mo CA. Design: A total of 79 of 152 children (52%) from the original randomized controlled trial were enrolled for follow-up at age 8 y. Weight, height, and head circumference were measured by using standard methods. Body composition, including fat mass, lean mass, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density, was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Blood pressure was measured in the supine position by using an automatic device. Metabolic variables, including glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, triglycerides, cholesterol, cortisol, and leptin, were measured after an overnight fast. Nutritional habits at age 8 y were assessed by using a 3-d nutritional diary. Results: At age 8 y, no differences were found in body size, body composition, bone variables, and metabolic health variables when comparing children fed PDF with those fed TF. Adjustment for known and possible confounders did not change these results. Conclusions: In this follow-up study in preterm-born children, we showed that the favorable effects of PDF at 6-mo CA either were not maintained or could not be confirmed because of attrition at the age of 8 y. We suggest that future research should focus on nutritional interventions in the pre-and postdischarge period as a continuum rather than as separate entities. This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR 2972 (follow-up study [STEP-2 (Study Towards the Effects of Post-discharge Nutrition 2)]) and NTR 55 [original randomized controlled trial (STEP)].",
