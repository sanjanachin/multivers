Method: Twenty-seven PHO patients were recruited to participate in a prospective, randomized study in Turkey. The researcher used care bundles with chlorhexidine dressing in the experimental group (n \u00bc 14), and care bundles with advanced dressings in the control group (n \u00bc 13). Results: According to the study results, 28.6% of the patients in the experimental group had CRBSI, while this rate was 38.5% in the control group patients. The CRBSI rate in the experimental group was 3.9, and the control group had 4.4 per 1000 inpatient catheter days. There was no exit-site infection in the experimental group. However, the control group had 1.7 per 1000 inpatient catheter days. Conclusions: Even though there was no difference between the two groups in which the researcher implemented care bundles with chlorhexidine dressing and advanced dressings in terms of CRBSI development, there was reduction in the CRBSI rates thanks to the care bundle approach. It is possible to control the CRBSI rates using care bundles in pediatric hematology-oncology patients.",

(2014) applied a very comprehensive and extensive care bundle based on the recommendations and standards provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and reduced the catheter days from Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) from 2.85 to 2.04 per 1000 catheter days. The care bundle was administered for three years, which is a relatively long intervention period, and the study was successful in decreasing the incidence of CLABSI; yet, this decrease was not statistically associated with the changes in CRBSI rates. Rinke et al. (2012) reduced CLABSI rates from 2.2 to 1.79 in the baseline period and 2.2 to 0.81 CLABSIs per 1000 catheter days in the second 12 months of the intervention. In Choi et al. (2013) found that their pre-intervention CLABSI incidence was 2.92 per 1000 catheter days, in the post-intervention period their CLABSI rate decreased substantially to 1.61 per 1000 catheter days. Although the decrease in the study by Rinke et al. (2012) was not significant, the decrease found by Choi et al. (2013) was significant. In this regard, the factor determining the statistical significance of the decrease is the number of total catheter days. Duffy et al. (2015) evaluated CVC daily maintenance-care bundle compliance and CLABSI, and CLABSI rates decreased during their intervention. Four of the six months during their intervention period had a CLABSI rate of zero. But, CLABSI rates were not statistically significant. Considering the possible effects of these decreases on patient safety, costeffectiveness and the mortality of PHO population, the decreases appear to be important. It was observed that the relevant studies managed to reduce or even prevent CLABSI, and there were remarkable decreases in the studies that were conducted with pediatric populations when administering a catheter maintenance bundle (Ahmed et al., 2012; Costello et al., 2009; Jeffries et al., 2009; McKee et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2011) . Despite being statistically insignificant, the CRBSI rate was reduced to 3.9 in the experimental group and to 4.4 per 1000 inpatient cathater days in the control group. Thus, the decrease was 50% in the experimental group and 43% in the control group. Even though these reduction rates were successful, the absence of a difference between the experimental and control groups regarding CRBSI showed that the care bundle with chlorhexidine-containing transparent dressings were not more effective than the care bundle with transparent dressings in preventing CRBSI. There are no studies conducted to compare the care bundles. However, there is evidence found by studies examining the effectiveness of chlorhexidine dressings that they prevent CRBSI (Timsit et al., 2012 (Timsit et al., , 2009 , but there are only a limited number of studies conducted with pediatric populations focusing on chlorhexidine dressings (Levy et al., 2005) . The other studies in this area mainly have a \"before and after\" design (Ahmed et al., 2012) . The study by Ahmed et al. (2012) is similar to this one; it used a multidisciplinary approach to include different elements such as placing chlorhexidine-impregnated disks and using needleless connectors instead of stopcocks. The elements undertaken in this multidisciplinary approaches (Ahmed et al., 2012; McKee et al., 2008) like this study, are components of care bundle.

        "text": "There was no exit-site infection development in the experimental group patients, which shows that chlorhexidine-containing transparent dressings are effective in the prevention of exit-site infection. Of the patients with CRBSI in the experimental group, 50% had R. pickettii, and 60% of the patients in the control group had CoNS. There was no statistically significant difference between experimental and control groups regarding the reproducing microorganisms. In Timsit et al. (2009) , CoNS was the microorganism which was the most frequent cause of catheter colonization in the groups of chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings and control dressings. The reproductions in the experimental and control groups were similar to each other in this study as well; CoNS led to colonization in three patients in the control group and in one patient in the experimental group. This result shows that the care bundle with chlorhexidine-containing transparent dressings reduced the catheter colonization caused by CoNS. R. pickettii was another common microorganism observed in this study. It is a gram-negative microorganism that should be handled carefully. A patient who was not in the research group came to the unit four days after discharge due to high fever, and was hospitalized. There was R. pickettii reproduction in the first blood culture of the patient which was drawn in 48 h. In the days following this case, there was R. pickettii reproduction in two patients in the experimental group and in one patient in the control group. R. pickettii has very high virulence and it can be caused by contaminated solutions including distilled water, injection waters, and even chlorhexidine solutions. It may also cause serious infections including meningitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis (Ryan et al., 2006) . Due to the CRBSI that resulted from this pathogen, the researcher had to remove the catheters from a majority of the patients in the study. For instance; in the case of CoNS in tunneled CVCs, clinicians may decide to remove the catheter without the confirmation of the laboratory if the patients are septic or they cannot control the patients' fever (Boersma et al., 2007) . The structure of the units that receive care and treatment of PHO patients is very important. In this study and in all studies in the relevant literature, taking control of the environmental conditions has a primary importance on CRBSI prevention efforts. The CRBSI rate increased due to the presence of R. pickettii, however, despite this increase, this study was successful in creating a significant reduction in the CRBSI rate. Although the previous studies have found reduced infection rates, there is the possibility of serious methodological limitations. CRBSI rates may be higher. It is necessary to focus on patient safety in studies to be able to comply with quality development initiatives (Huskins, 2012) . The researcher believes that this study produced important results by having patient safety as the primary concern.",
