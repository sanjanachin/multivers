We assessed the effect of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women on neurodevelopment of their offspring in areas where schoolchildren were iodine sufficient. Methods In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, pregnant women in Bangalore, India, and Bangkok, Thailand, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 200 \u00b5g iodine orally once a day or placebo until delivery. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by site. Co-primary outcomes were verbal and performance IQ scores on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) and the global executive composite score from the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) in the children at age 5-6 years. The trial was double-blinded; some unmasking took place at age 2 years for an interim analysis, but participants and nearly all investigators remained masked to group assignment until age 5-6 years. Analysis was by intention to treat using mixed-effects models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00791466.",

By contrast, WHO does not recommend maternal iodine supplements in countries with iodised salt programmes, 14 concluding that if women are iodine sufficient before they enter pregnancy, they can cover their requirements by increasing fractional clearance of plasma iodide and drawing from thyroidal iodine stores. Of concern, observational studies have linked excessive maternal iodine intake with mild maternal hypothyroidism, 15 and maternal iodine supple mentation with impaired infant development. 9 Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of iodine supplementation in mildly iodinedeficient pregnant women on child neurodevelopment.

The cognitive scale includes items such as attention to objects and pretend play. The language scale assesses understanding and expression of language, object recognition, and following directions. The motor scale assesses gross and fine motor skills including grasping, stacking blocks, sitting, and climbing stairs. We did not assess the socialemotional or adaptive behaviour scales, which are done with parent questionnaires. We used raw scores because agespecific norms were not available for the Indian or Thai populations and the assessments at both sites occurred within a narrow age window. The BSIDIII raw scores were adjusted for infant's gestational age at birth. When children were aged between 5 and 6 years, we measured height and weight, obtained a fingerprick blood sample and a spot urine sample, and obtained audiograms using a GrasonStadler GSI 61 audiometer (GrasonStadler, Eden Prairie, USA). During the acoustic testing, pure tone was determined as average level of signal response during two ascending processes. Starting signal level was about 10 dB below the level at which the child responded during the familiarisation session. The signal was presented for 2-3 s; if the child failed to respond to the signal, the level was increased by 5 dB until the child responded. The time between presentations was about 5 s. To assess verbal and performance IQ, performance speed quotient, and full scale IQ, we administered the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSIIII) individually for each child. 21 an 86item questionnaire in eight clinical scales and two validity scales; the global executive composite score takes into account all of the clinical scales and represents the child's overall executive function. To assess behaviour, we administered the Strengths and Difficulties Question naire (SDQ) to the mother of each child. 23 Each of its five scales were scored from 0 to 10, the emotional and peer items were summed for an internalising problems score (range 0-20), the conduct and hyperactivity items summed for an externalising problems score (range 0-20), and four of the scales (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems) were summed to create a total difficulty score (range 0-40). All of the developmental tests have been widely used in Thailand and India and were administered in the local language. However, populationspecific norms were not available and because there were several months of variation in the children's age at the time of testing, BRIEFP and WPPSIIII scaled scores were generated using US norms for both sites, allowing us to pool the data.

Thyroid function tests from the mothers were measured only after delivery. From the thyroid ultrasound measurements, we calculated thyroid volume as previously described. 3 We defined low birthweight as weight at birth of less than 2\u20225 kg irrespective of gestational age, 28 preterm birth as gesta tional age at birth of less than 37 completed weeks, and stunting as heightforage more than two SDs below the WHO Child Growth Standards median. 29 On the WPPSIIII, we defined a score of lower than 85 as abnormally low and a score of lower than 70 as severely abnormally low. 21 We analysed data using R (version 3.3.1). We ran de scriptive statistics for all variables. From crude continuous variables, we identified outliers by visual inspection of box plots stratified by group and timepoint. We assessed normality by testing the distribution of continuous variables against a normal distribution using the Shapiro Wilk W test. When departing significantly from normality, the variables were transformed using log(x), sqrt(x), or -1/x to correct positive skewness or x\u00b2, x\u00b3, or antilog(x) to correct negative skewness, until achieving W>0\u202297 before proceeding with further data analysis. Values in the text and tables are presented as mean (SD) for normally distributed data, median (IQR) for nonnormal data, and number (%) for prevalence. We assessed the intervention effect by fitting linear mixed effects models to continuous dependent variables and by fitting logistic regression mixed effects models to categorical dependent variables using maximum likelihood procedure for the estimation of variance components. Analysis was intention to treat and missing values were dropped from analysis by listwise deletion. During gestation, we defined the fixed effects on the variance as treatment, trimester, treatmentbytrimester interaction, household average monthly in come, maternal education, and maternal BMI at trial entry; the random structure was defined as study site=~trimester*treatment and individual=~trimester, to control for betweenstudy site and betweenindividual differences, respectively.

Although we found higher scores on one subtest of the BSIDIII at 1 year (favouring placebo), there were no significant differences between groups in all other tests, including the coprimary outcomes (WPPSIIII verbal and performance IQ scores and BRIEFP global executive composite score at mean age 5\u20224 years). Thus, iodine supplementation of pregnant women who were mildly iodine deficient at baseline did not affect overall child neurodevelopment. In cohort studies in the UK and Australia, more severe maternal iodine deficiency than in our study (maternal median urinary iodine concentration of 91 \u00b5g/L and 81 \u00b5g/L, respectively) was associated with lower IQ 7 and reduced educational outcomes 8 at school age. However, findings from other cohort studies showed no difference in neurodevelopment in infants of mothers who had mild iodine deficiency or iodine sufficiency. 9 It is likely that any potential benefits of maternal iodine supplementation on offspring development would be caused by correction of mild maternal or fetal hypothyroidism; however, two controlled trials 31, 32 have reported that correction of sub clinical hypothyroidism or isolated hypothyroxinaemia with levothyroxine did not improve offspring development; one of these trials was in an iodinedeficient population. 32 We tested children at age 5-6 years because investigation at this age allows assessment of a wider array of cognitive functions, as opposed to broad domainwise assessment (motor, cognitive) in infancy. Scores on the BSIDIII at 1 and 2 years show only modest association with adult IQ, and developmental tests in children at 5 years or older are better predictors of adult intelligence than tests given during infancy. 33 The pregnant women in our study had a median urinary iodine concentration of 131 \u03bcg/L at baseline; this degree of mild maternal iodine deficiency is common worldwide: the national median concentration in preg nant women is 100-150 \u03bcg/L in many highincome and lowincome countries, despite adequate median urinary iodine concentrations in schoolaged children. 4, 6, 16 By site, the median urinary iodine concentration of the women in Thailand was in the deficient range while in India it was at the lower end of iodine sufficiency. Despite this difference, there were no sitespecific differences in the effects of iodine supplementation on the primary outcomes (appendix p 6). We chose a daily dose of 200 \u00b5g because expert recommendations vary: the American Thyroid Association 12 and the European Thyroid Association 13 recommend 150 \u00b5g per day whereas WHO recommends 250 \u00b5g per day. 3 The 200 \u03bcg dose of iodine was effective: in the iodine group, median urinary iodine concentration increased to 231-247 \u03bcg/L in the second and third trimesters, at the upper end of the reference range for pregnancy of 150-249 \u03bcg/L. 3 Iodine supplementation had minimal effects on maternal thyroid function; there were no differences in thyroid disorders between the iodine and placebo groups, and nearly all women were euthyroid. The marginally higher TSH and thyroglobulin concentrations in the placebo group might represent physiological adaptation of the maternal thyroid to low iodine intake through increased turnover of thyroidal iodine stores. However, these small differences in thyroid function (as well as the slight Continuous data were analysed using linear mixed effect models with non-transformed or transformed dependent variable, and frequencies were analysed using mixed effects logistic regression. During gestation: testing the interaction effect of time (first to third trimester) by treatment (iodine vs placebo) and controlling for household average monthly income, maternal education, and maternal BMI at trial entry.

It was randomised and placebocontrolled, compliance was high, and the baseline median urinary iodine concentration was representative of mild iodine deficiency reported in many national studies of pregnant women. We assessed thyroid function at multiple prenatal and postnatal timepoints, and comprehensively assessed neuro cognitive outcomes including IQ and executive functions and behaviour at early school age to increase validity. 33 Asking mothers to rate their own child using SDQ and the BRIEFP might have introduced bias, although this would probably have been similar between groups. The women began iodine supplementation at a mean gestational age of 10\u20227 weeks. Beginning supple mentation earlier might have resulted in different findings, because the fetal brain rapidly develops in the first trimester. 1,2 However, we did not find an effect of gestational age at entry on any of the developmental outcomes in a secondary analysis of the iodine group. We confirmed iodine sufficiency in offspring using repeated measurements of urinary iodine concentration; the only significant difference in median urinary iodine concentrations were due to increased maternal iodine intakes caused by supplementation during gestation.",

We did not collect 24 h urine samples or measure urinary creatinine because these often do not reduce withinindividual variability compared with a spot urinary iodine concentration. 34 The median urinary iodine concentration in the placebo group remained within the recommended range (although at the lower end) in the second and third trimesters; 3 this finding might have been caused by a physiological increase in renal iodine clearance 5 or by being enrolled into the study and being told about the importance of iodine nutrition during pregnancy, prompting the women to consume more iodinerich foods, which might have biased our trial towards a null effect. The dropout rate was high around delivery because many women returned to their hometowns to deliver or care for their babies; thereafter, attrition was low and most children remained in the study. Attrition was balanced between groups, the study was randomised, and there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between those who completed the study and those lost to followup by delivery, suggesting no strong attrition bias that would compromise generalisability.
