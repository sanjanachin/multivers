        "text": "Background: Hen's egg is the most common cause of food allergy in early childhood. Objective: We investigated the efficacy and safety of early hen's egg introduction at age 4 to 6 months to prevent hen's egg allergy in the general population. Methods: This randomized, placebo-controlled trial included 4to 6-month-old infants who were not sensitized against hen's egg, as determined based on specific serum antibodies (IgE). These infants were randomized to receive either verum (egg white powder) or placebo (rice powder) added to the first weaning food 3 times a week under a concurrent egg-free diet from age 4 to 6 until 12 months. The primary outcome was sensitization to hen's egg (increased specific serum IgE levels) by age 12 months. Hen's egg allergy (secondary outcome) was confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. Results: Among 406 screened infants, 23 (5.7%) had hen's egg-specific IgE before randomization. Seventeen of 23 underwent subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, and 16 were confirmed as allergic, including 11 with anaphylactic reactions. Of the 383 nonsensitized infants (56.7% male), 184 were randomized to verum and 199 to placebo. At 12 months of age, 5.6% of the children in the verum group were hen's egg sensitized versus 2.6% in the placebo group (primary outcome; relative risk, 2.20; 95% CI, 0.68-7.14; P 5 .24), and 2.1% were confirmed to have hen's egg allergy versus 0.6% in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.30; 95% CI, 0.35-31.32; P 5 .35). Conclusion: We found no evidence that consumption of hen's egg starting at 4 to 6 months of age prevents hen's egg sensitization or allergy. In contrast, it might result in frequent allergic reactions in the community considering that many 4-to 6-month-old infants were already allergic to hen's egg. (J",

Considering that a large number of infants were already sensitized and allergic in both studies, it might be beneficial to focus on oral tolerance induction with a less allergenic form of hen's egg, such as heat-treated egg. In the observational Health-Nuts Study the early introduction of cooked egg was associated with a lower risk of hen's egg allergy at 11 to 15 months than the early introduction of baked egg, a finding that might suggest that a more allergenic form of hen's egg protein is more protective. However, the allergenicity of cooked and baked egg is highly dependent on the temperature and duration of heating, whereby the duration was found to have more influence on the composition and allergenicity of egg white proteins than the temperature. 24 In the recently published British Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study, exclusively breast-fed infants were recruited at age 3 months from a general population and randomly assigned to a standard-introduction group with exclusive breast-feeding until 6 months of age and an early-introduction group with introduction of 6 allergenic foods, including cooked (boiled) hen's egg. 25 In the modified intent-to-treat analysis the prevalence of allergy to cooked egg was nonsignificantly lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group. 25 In the perprotocol analysis this difference became statistically significant. 25 However, only one third of the infants originally allocated to the early-introduction group could be represented by the hen's egg-specific per-protocol population, whereas the rate of adherence to the protocol was the lowest for egg compared with the other 5 allergenic foods. 25 In the analysis of factors influencing early-introduction group nonadherence, the reporting of symptoms to any of the 6 allergenic foods was found to be a statistically significant factor (see the Appendix by Perkin et al 25 ).",
