The Transporters (TT) animated series has shown promising results in teaching children with ASD to recognize emotions, with mixed findings about generalization and maintenance of effects. This study aimed to evaluate the unique role of TT and of parental support in the acquisition, generalization, and maintenance of acquired ER skills in children with ASD. 77 Israeli children with high functioning ASD, aged 4-7 were randomly assigned into four groups according to a 2 3 2 design of the factors Series (TT, control series) and Parental Support (with/without). Thirty typically developing children, matched to the ASD groups on mental age, were tested with no intervention. Participants' ER (on three generalization levels) and emotional vocabulary (EV) were tested pre and post 8 weeks of intervention, and at 3 months' follow-up. Compared to the control series, watching TT significantly improved children's ER skills at all generalization levels, with good skill maintenance. All groups improved equally on EV. The amount of parental support given, in the groups that had received it, contributed to the generalization and maintenance of ER skills. Autism severity negatively correlated with ER improvement. The current study provides evidence to the unique role of TT in ER skill acquisition, generalization, and maintenance in children with high functioning ASD. In addition, this study provides evidence for a successful cultural adaptation of TT to a non-English speaking culture.",

Such difficulties have been identified through cognitive, behavioral, and neuro-imaging studies, which have demonstrated difficulties in recognizing emotions from facial expressions [Golan, Sinai-Gavrilov, & Baron-Cohen, 2015; Hobson, 1986] , from vocal intonation [Golan, Baron-Cohen, Hill, & Rutherford, 2007; Paul, Augustyn, Klin, & Volkmar, 2005] ; from contextual information [Happe, 1994] , and from the integration of multimodal emotional information [Golan, Baron-Cohen, & Golan, 2008; Yirmiya, Sigman, Kasari, & Mundy, 1992] . In addition, individuals with ASD tend to use less emotional and mental state words in their speech [Tager-Flusberg, 1992 . Children with ASD process faces differently and show reduced attention to faces and to facial expressions [Dawson et al., 2004; Klin et al., 2002] . They may also not find others' facial expressions intrinsically rewarding, possibly due to the mentalistic and emotional information conveyed by the eyes [Baron-Cohen, 1995] and facial expressions, which they find hard to read. Developmentally, deficits in attending to emotional cues in ASD, such as facial expressions, may lead to lack of specialization in collection of relevant emotional information and its interpretation. Redirecting children's attention to these cues may facilitate emotional understanding and consequently social functioning [Dawson & Zanolli, 2003; Howlin, 1998 ].",

TT aims to teach children with ASD about emotions, their causes and effects, and their corresponding facial expressions. In order to motivate children with ASD to learn about emotions and to look at facial expressions, real-life faces of actors expressing emotions were grafted onto eight rail-based vehicle characters, who take part in the series' fifteen 5-min long episodes. Each episode focuses on a key emotion or mental state (including: happy, sad, angry, afraid, disgusted, surprised, excited, tired, unfriendly, kind, sorry, proud, jealous, joking, and ashamed) , presenting it through a short narrated story, while labeling the emotion, highlighting the facial expression, and providing the context underlying the emotional experience. The mechanical, rule-based motion of the characters was assumed to be autism-friendly due to its predictable, repetitive, nature. Repeated watching of TT's episodes enables children with ASD, instead of avoiding faces, to tune into them without even realizing they are doing so, allowing them to pick up crucial information for learning about emotional expressions. The wide developmental range of the curriculum ensured that the series would be relevant as a teaching tool for children with ASD throughout early childhood.
