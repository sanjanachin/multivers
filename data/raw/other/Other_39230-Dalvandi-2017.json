The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of vapocoolant spray and EMLA cream in reduction of pain during venous cannulation in 6-12 years old children. Methods: The study was a randomized clinical trial with a crossover design. It took place between June and December 2015 at Ali-Asghar hospital in Tehran, Iran. 40 Thalassemic children who need regular blood transfusions were randomly assigned in two groups. The pain of intravenous cannulation was measured using a visual analogue scale for pain (VAS-P). With the crossover design each patient received vapocoolant spray and EMLA cream in the next two visits. The patients were allocated into two groups (A and B). The patients in Group (A) received Vapocoolant spray in the first visit and EMLA cream in the second visit before intravenous cannulation. The patients in Group (B) group were exposed to the opposite order. Results: The pain after Vapocoolant spray was 3.22 \u00b1 1.18 which was significantly lower than control (7.12 \u00b1 1.36) and higher than EMLA cream (0.77 \u00b1 1.09), p N 0.001. The anxiety before cannulation had a significant effects on the reported pain by children. The ANCOVA showed that despite the effects of anxiety the results did not change significantly. Conclusion: The results indicated that vapocoolant spray was not as effective as EMLA cream, in the event of an emergency and in patients with allergic reactions to lidocaine and procaine ingredients Vapocoolant is an efficacious alternative.",

Within this study [23] a mean of 34 mm for pain was reported after using vapocoolant spray, which was the same as our result but their control measurement rated pain as 31 mm, which was lower than our results and also lower than their intervention. These differing findings may also be attributable to the age of the sample, that is, the sample was selected from children between the ages of 9 to 18 years which was higher than the ages represented within the current study. Moreover, these differing results may be caused by an under-rating of pain, which was reported in control measurement.",

Although EMLA reduces pain to a greater extent than vapocoolants or no intervention, the time taken for EMLA to take effect, the means by which it is administered requiring the use of a needle injection (the latter associated with more pain for children and the risk of needle stick injuries); may provide an argument for the use of vapocoolants especially in emergency situations.
