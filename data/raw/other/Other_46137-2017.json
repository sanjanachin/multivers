        "text": "Introduction: Anesthesia induction is a stressful event for children and their parents, and may have potentially harmful consequences on the patient's physiological and mental situation. Stressful anesthesia induction has psychological adverse effects that recur with repeated anesthesia, can lead to increased pediatric discomfort during the recovery period, and may even induce reactionary postoperative behavior. A randomized controlled trial was performed to assess the impact of parental presence during induction of anesthesia (PPIA) on preoperative anxiety of pediatric patients and their parents at three different times, cooperation of child with anesthesiologist at induction of anesthesia, and parental satisfaction. Patients and methods: A total of 96 pediatric patients undergoing elective minor surgery (ASA 1-2) were randomly divided into two groups. Both groups received oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) at least 20 minutes before surgery, but in the PPIA group, the parents were also present in the operating room until loss of consciousness of child at anesthesia induction. Anxiety in the patients (as measured by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale [mYPAS]) and parents (as measured by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]), the Induction Compliance Checklist (ICC), and parental satisfaction (as measured by visual analog scale) were assessed. Results: There was no significant difference in the mean anxiety scores (mYPAS) of participants in the control and PPIA groups at ward T0 and upon arrival to operating room T1 (P>0.05). However, between the PPIA and control groups, mean mYPAS score was different at the time of induction of anesthesia T2 (35.5\u00b116.6 vs 59.8\u00b122.4; P<0.001). The ICC scores showed that perfect score was significantly deferent in the PPIA and control groups (66.6% vs 6.3%; P<0.01). The STAI scores of the parents in the two groups did not differ in T0, T1, and T2. The mean parental satisfaction score was higher in the PPIA group than in the control group (7.6\u00b17.0 vs 5.8\u00b16.1; P<0.01). Conclusion: PPIA may reduce preoperative state anxiety of pediatric patients and improve quality of anesthesia induction based on ICC scores and higher parental satisfaction, but it does not impact on parental state anxiety.",

This is similar to results of Caprilli et al, 4 Astuto et al, 14 and Cameron et al. 15 Astuto et al reported that PPIA can reduce anxiety, fear, and the need for sedative agents in pediatric patients. 14 Rice et al used the Yale anxiety index to determine the anxiety levels of 94 pediatric patients at T0, T1, and T2. This group reported that an educational training session had a suitable impact on controlling anxiety in all of these situations, but only had a significant impact on anxiety at the time of T2. 2 In contrast to our findings, Kain et al 6 and Palermo et al 7 reported that PPIA had no impact on anxiety scores in pediatric patients. Lui and Wu concluded that PPIA does not reduce anxiety in pediatric patients. 16 Arai et al divided pediatric patients into one of three groups, who received a sedative (midazolam 0.5 mg/kg), PPIA, or PPIA and a sedative. They reported that the addition of PPIA to administration of oral midazolam does not improve the quality of anesthesia induction. 8 A longitudinal study conducted by Kain et al showed that some variables such as age, behavior at the previous visit, anxiety level, and anxiety control in parents are independent predictors of anxiety. 6 Kain et al also reported that anxious patients who received PPIA from quiet parents had lower anxiety scores during anesthesia induction compared to quiet patients who received PPIA from anxious parents. 17 Another finding of our study suggests that prescribing PPIA with midazolam during anesthesia induction can significantly improve the behavior and function of pediatric patients using ICC scores. In agreement with our results, Varughese et al reported that the function of more than half of pediatric patients increases when parents are present during anesthesia induction. 18 We assessed the relation between age and high anxiety scores (mYPAS >40).
