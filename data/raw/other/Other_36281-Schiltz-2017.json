The present data, from a randomized controlled trial, examined the effect of PEERS \u00ae on self-reported depressive symptoms via the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) among 49 adolescents with ASD. Findings revealed that many CDI subscale scores declined (p's < 0.05) and were related to direct social contact on the Quality of Socialization Questionnaire at posttest (p's < 0.05). Exploratory analyses uncovered that suicidality was less evident following PEERS \u00ae. Findings support the notion that social functioning and depression may be intimately intertwined in ASD; therefore, bolstering social skills in ASD may positively influence other domains of functioning, including mental health.",

Participants provided selfreport on the Children's Depression Index (CDI; Kovacs 1992) at two time points. The EXP group completed the CDI before and after PEERS \u00ae ; the WL group completed reports on the CDI approximately 14 weeks apart and participated in PEERS \u00ae thereafter. In any instance in which suicidality was endorsed on item 9 of the CDI, a formal risk assessment was delivered by graduate students in the clinical psychology doctoral program per the clinic's suicidal ideation protocol which involved safety planning, when appropriate.

The CDI has been used previously with ASD samples (e.g., Lerner et al. 2012; Solomon et al. 2012; Vickerstaff et al. 2007) and has shown evidence of promising psychometric properties in an ASD sample (Ozsivadjian et al. 2014) . Further, it has demonstrated sensitivity to treatment response in both ASD (Solomon et al. 2004 ) and non-ASD samples (P\u00f6ssel et al. 2013; Weisz et al. 1997) . This measure yields a total score and the following subscale scores: Negative mood (example item: \"I am sad once in a while, many times, or all the time.\"), interpersonal problems (example item: \"I get along with people, I get into fights many times, or I get into fights all the time.\"), Ineffectiveness (example item: \"I can never be as good as other kids, I can be as good as other kids if I want to, or I am just as good as other kids.\"), Anhedonia (example item: \"I have fun in many things, some things, or nothing is fun at all.\"), and negative self-esteem (example item: \"Nothing will ever work out for me, I am not sure if things will work out for me, or things will work out for me O.K.\"). Suicidal ideation is reported on question nine of the CDI that states: \"'I do not think of killing myself,' 'I think of killing myself but I would not do it,' or 'I want to kill myself.'\" T-scores on the CDI were used in all analyses. Internal consistency for the present study was acceptable at pretest (\u03b1 = 0.79) and good at posttest (\u03b1 = 0.82), comparable to previous reports of internal consistency of self-report on the measure in an ASD sample (Ozsivadjian et al. 2014) .",

Therefore, bolstering social skills among youth with ASD seems to influence other domains of functioning, including mental health. In this study, PEERS \u00ae functioned to reduce selfreported depressive symptoms, which is in line with the hypotheses. Subscales of the CDI including: Negative Mood, Ineffectiveness, Anhedonia, and Negative Self-Esteem demonstrated significant or marginally significant decreases in the experimental group after receiving PEERS \u00ae , while the waitlist control group showed no significant change. The interpersonal problems subscale, however, did not significantly decrease in the experimental group. This null finding is surprising, as PEERS \u00ae specifically targets social and interpersonal skills. It may be that the effects of PEERS \u00ae on interpersonal challenges, as measured by the CDI, is delayed; perhaps this domain of depression is less malleable and requires a longer duration of repeated social interactions to elicit change. This is merely speculation, however, as the data from the present study did not allow for the direct testing of this hypothesis. Therefore, this possibility requires direct investigation, namely via longer-term study following intervention (i.e., months or years later). As mentioned previously, although some literature exists, only a handful of studies have examined treatment response employing CDI subscales (e.g., Bursuk 1998; Nolan et al. 2002) . Additionally, the items of the Interpersonal Skills subscale may be a limiting factor; the items do not necessarily tap into social skills per se but, rather, a desire to be with others and to obey directions from other people.",
