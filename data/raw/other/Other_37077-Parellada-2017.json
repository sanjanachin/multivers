Although a two-week washout period was planned in order to diminish carryover effects, the dynamics of \u03c93 are not sufficiently known to ensure that the washout period was long enough, and 2) interventions that may potentially change the course of development (as in this case, improving the mechanistic and functional characteristics of the cell membranes) have not been well tested in a design that assumes that the system would revert to the previous status once the intervention ceases.",

Based on current knowledge, it is not possible to differentiate discrete subgroups of ASD subjects according to pathophysiologic pathways involved that may benefit from different interventions with distinct biological targets (i.e. synaptic formation, immune modulation, etc.). This precludes-at least for the time being -selection of more homogeneous ASD samples for clinical trials; second, the lack of teachers assessment of baseline behavior and changes. SRS teacher assessments have been shown to correlate better with severity of autism behaviors than parent assessments (Azad et al., 2016) . However, the response rate of teacher questionnaires was too low to include these in the analyses; the drawback of not having teacher assessment is mitigated by two facts: i) patients included in the trial are in a severe range, and in this subgroup parent and teacher scores correlate (Azad et al., 2016) and ii) parents were blind to treatment status. Finally, dose selection was based on age, but further studies should try to establish the appropriate doses to give and to examine whether body weight or age is more suitable for determining them.",
