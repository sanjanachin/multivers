Methods: Forty parturients with a single newborn who were scheduled for caesarean section were enrolled. Patients received 0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine 10 min after epidural anaesthesia, followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h until abdominal closure (Dex group) or infusion of normal saline (NS group). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) were monitored before infusion (T0), 10 min after infusion (T1), at delivery (T2), and at the end of the operation (T3). Umbilical vein and artery blood was collected. Apgar scores were evaluated at 1 and 5 min after delivery. Results: SBP, DBP, and HR in the Dex group were decreased at T3 compared with T0 (116 AE 10.4 vs 111 AE 9.2 mmHg, 74 AE 6.7 vs 66 AE 7.9 mmHg, 91 AE 12.1 vs 71 AE 8.4 beats/min, respectively, P < 0.05). HR was lower at T1, T2, and T3 in the Dex group compared with the NS group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in blood gases and Apgar scores between the groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine during caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia is beneficial to parturients. The placental transfer rate is 0.68.",

In our study, use of dexmedetomidine had no significant effect on newborn blood gases. There was also no significant difference in the Apgar score at 1 and 5 min.

Haemodynamic changes in our study might have been related to the mechanism of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine excites presynaptic a2-AR to inhibit release of norepinephrine, preventing signal transduction of pain. Dexmedetomidine also excites postsynaptic a2 receptors, causing nerve cell membrane hyperpolarization 13 . The combined effects of these two mechanisms reduce plasma catecholamine concentrations, inhibit release of central sympathetic nerves, inhibit sympathetic nerve tension, and enhance vagus nerve activity. This reaction reduces HR and blood pressure. After treatment in our study, SBP and DBP in the Dex group at T3 were lower than those in the NS group. Additionally, HR at each time point after infusion in the Dex group was lower than that in the NS group. These findings suggested that dexmedetomidine reduced the stress response during surgery, and that maternal haemodynamics during the whole operation are stable. Additionally, because of the effect of a2-AR activation by dexmedetomidine, leading to contraction of vascular smooth muscle, rapid intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine caused a high blood pressure and low HR. Therefore, the loading dose infusion time of dexmedetomidine should be longer. In this study, we set the infusion time of the loading dose of dexmedetomidine for 10 min. Moreover, the transient rise in blood pressure by dexmedetomidine could alleviate hypotension after epidural anaesthesia.",

Another study showed that the rate of placental transfer of dexmedetomidine in caesarean section under general anaesthesia was 0.76 4 . These findings indicate that dexmedetomidine can easily pass through the placental barrier, similar to other anaesthetic drugs. However, the placental transfer rate of dexmedetomidine is much lower than that of clonidine (0.85) and that of remifentanil (0.88) 17, 18 . The reason for this difference may be caused by dexmedetomidine being more fat-soluble and easier to be retained in the placenta 18 . In our study, dexmedetomidine passed through the placenta with a transfer rate of 0.68, which is lower than that in previous studies. This difference between studies could be because mean arterial pressure under epidural anaesthesia is lower than that under general anaesthesia or in vitro perfusion pressure. After epidural anaesthesia, sympathetic ganglia are blocked, with dilation of small arteries, capillaries, and small veins. Venous return and blood pressure are also decreased, and thus blood flow passing through the placenta and perfusion pressure are decreased. Therefore, the transfer rate of dexmedetomidine in epidural anaesthesia through the placenta is lower, which is safer for newborns. Our finding that CUA/ CUV \u00bc 0.76 indicated foetal metabolism or redistribution of dexmedetomidine. There is a lack of any relevant systematic study for comparison with our result.

            "Another study showed that the rate of placental transfer of dexmedetomidine in caesarean section under general anaesthesia was 0.76 4 .",
            "These findings indicate that dexmedetomidine can easily pass through the placental barrier, similar to other anaesthetic drugs.",
            "However, the placental transfer rate of dexmedetomidine is much lower than that of clonidine (0.85) and that of remifentanil (0.88) 17, 18 .",
            "The reason for this difference may be caused by dexmedetomidine being more fat-soluble and easier to be retained in the placenta 18 .",
            "In our study, dexmedetomidine passed through the placenta with a transfer rate of 0.68, which is lower than that in previous studies.",
            "This difference between studies could be because mean arterial pressure under epidural anaesthesia is lower than that under general anaesthesia or in vitro perfusion pressure.",
            "After epidural anaesthesia, sympathetic ganglia are blocked, with dilation of small arteries, capillaries, and small veins.",
            "Venous return and blood pressure are also decreased, and thus blood flow passing through the placenta and perfusion pressure are decreased.",
            "Therefore, the transfer rate of dexmedetomidine in epidural anaesthesia through the placenta is lower, which is safer for newborns.",
            "Our finding that CUA/ CUV \u00bc 0.76 indicated foetal metabolism or redistribution of dexmedetomidine.",
            "There is a lack of any relevant systematic study for comparison with our result.",
            "Therefore, the importance of this finding needs to be further studied."
