The objective of this study was to determine the effect of daily zinc and/or multivitamin (vitamins C, E and B-complex) supplements on development among Tanzanian infants. In this randomized, 2 \u00d7 2 factorial, double-blind trial, 2400 infants were randomized to zinc (Zn), multivitamins (MV), zinc and multivitamins (Zn + MV) or placebo at 6 weeks of age. At approximately 15 months, a sub-sample of 247 children underwent developmental assessment using the cognitive, language (receptive and expressive) and motor (fine and gross) scales of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III). Mean BSID-III scores were compared using univariate and multivariate linear regression models adjusted for child's sex, post-conceptual age and test administrator. Logistic regressions were used to assess odds of low developmental scores. We did not detect a significant difference in mean BSID-III scores in any of the five domains in univariate or multivariate models comparing each of the four treatment groups. We also did not detect a significant difference in mean BSID-III scores when comparing children who received zinc supplements versus those who did not, or in comparisons of children who received multivitamin supplements versus those who did not. There was no significant difference in odds of a low BSID-III score in any of the five domains in treatment arms either. Because neither daily zinc nor multivitamin (vitamins B-complex, C and E) supplementation led to improvements in any of the developmental domains assessed using the BSID-III, we recommend pursuing alternative interventions to promote early childhood development in vulnerable populations.",

The supplements were provided as opaque capsules containing an orange-flavoured powder manufactured by Nutriset (Malaunay, France). Nutriset manufactured the nutrient supplements in a good manufacturing practice (GMP)certified pharmaceutical laboratory and performed all required analyses of the supplements to confirm nutrient content and stability. Mothers were instructed to push the capsule through the back of the blister pack, open the capsule and empty the contents into a clean plastic cup, mix with 5 mL of sterile water and administer the solution to the child orally. All four regimens were tested to ensure they were indistinguishable in appearance, smell and taste. For infants receiving Zn, each capsule contained 5 mg of zinc sulfate. For infants in the MV group, each capsule contained 60 mg of vitamin C, 8 mg of vitamin E, 0.5 mg of vitamin B1, 0.6 mg of vitamin B2, 4 mg of niacin, 0.6 mg of B6, 130 \u03bcg of folic acid and 1 \u03bcg of vitamin B12. From the time of randomization until 6 months of age, infants received one capsule per day, representing between 150% and 600% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) or adequate intake (AI) for the different micronutrients for infants in this age range. From 7 months of age until the end of follow-up, infants received two capsules per day representing 150-400% of the RDA or AI for 7-to 15-month-olds. The dosage of the supplements was selected in order to maximize the likelihood of seeing an impact of supplementation (by providing doses substantially above the RDA), while also staying within a limited range so as to be considered safe for young children. At each monthly follow-up visit, trained study nurses assessed regimen compliance by counting the number of unconsumed capsules. Overall compliance was defined as the mean percentage of capsules a child consumed over the number of capsules he/she should have consumed between visits. At approximately 15 months of age, a sub-sample of 247 children was selected from a single research site (Magomeni Hospital) due to training and space restrictions. We chose to assess the children at 15 months because this was near the conclusion of the study and therefore allowed the near maximum duration of supplementation.",

It is worth noting that mothers in the second study received vitamins B-complex, C and E supplementation during pregnancy and lactation, so it is likely that infants in both intervention and placebo groups had better baseline micronutrient status. Our results from the current study, where mothers did not receive supplementation with this particular combination of micronutrients, corroborate the findings that providing this combination of multivitamins directly to infants is unlikely to confer benefits for development.",

We only conducted a single neurodevelopmental assessment at~15 months of age, which prevents us from assessing the effect of micronutrient supplements earlier in infancy or longitudinally as children age. Our sample also has limited generalizability because our results in our urban sample cannot be generalized to rural populations where infants are likely to have worse nutritional status. However, our findings are likely generalizable to other periurban settings in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, although our sample size was sufficiently large to assess the main effect of supplementation, we had limited power to assess the effect of supplements in subgroups (such as low-birth-weight infants). Finally, it is also worth noting that while the BSID-III is suitable for identifying developmental delays, it is possible that it is not sensitive enough to identify smaller changes in developmental outcomes. Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, our study is the largest randomized controlled trial that assesses the effect of zinc and/or multiple micronutrients on child development in an African setting. The randomized design allowed us to rigorously assess whether there is a causal effect of daily supplementation of zinc or multiple micronutrients on neurodevelopmental outcomes. For instance, providing daily micronutrients at multiple times the RDA beginning at 6 weeks and continuing for over a year before assessment provides a particularly strong study design to assess whether direct provision of micronutrients to infants in this urban, African setting improves development. Our finding of a lack of effect of zinc and/or multivitamin supplements on ECD in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial highlights the importance of pursuing other strategies in vulnerable populations, particularly those that integrate nutrition with responsive caretaking and stimulation activities (Grantham-McGregor et al., 2014, United Nations Children's Fund and World Health Organisation, 2014) .",
