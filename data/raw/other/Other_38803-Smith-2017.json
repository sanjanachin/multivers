M edical providers who care for children, especially when they require a bedside procedure, commonly encounter an anxious patient. In pediatric emergency medicine, mitigation of procedural anxiety is a goal often achieved by pharmacologic sedation. For those who do not require intravenous access, the intranasal (IN) route offers a simple, effective means of medication delivery. 1 IN midazolam has been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety for children undergoing procedures in varied clinical settings. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] However, the local discomfort (often experienced as a burning sensation) associated with the administration of IN midazolam is perhaps its main disadvantage. This undesirable side effect has been described in both children and adults. [8] [9] [10] To counteract this adverse effect, some have proposed using topical lidocaine as an adjunct to IN midazolam. [11] [12] [13] Chiaretti et al. 14 described the use of lidocaine via mucosal atomizer prior to IN midazolam for pediatric procedural sedation. While parents of all subjects perceived that their children experienced minimal or no discomfort with IN midazolam, their study was descriptive, lacking a control group.

While this difference is statistically significant, one must ask whether such differences are of clinical significance for patients. Tomlinson et al. 19 have proposed that, in pediatric research involving self-report pain scales, a difference of 2 of 10 (or a change in one face) is the minimum difference that can be considered clinically significant. Although there were considerable methodologic differences, Tsze et al. 20 established an \"ideal clinically significant difference\" in pain score change of 3 points on a 10-point scale. These findings would indicate that the 5-point difference for our study cohort represents a considerable amelioration of pain for our patients. Another recommended approach to establishing clinical significance is to examine the number of subjects who have no more than minimal pain with the intervention. 19 In our population, 20 of 40 patients (50%) who received lidocaine had a WBS of 0 or 2, compared to 10/36 (28%) with placebo. For ease of use, staff familiarity, and patient preference, we felt that the WBS was most appropriate for our study. Many self-report pain scales have been developed and validated for pediatric patients, and the WBS is the most extensively studied of these. A 2010 systematic review of face scales for pediatric pain concluded that, among four well-tested instruments (of which the WBS was one), none could be recommended over another. While other scales may be more appropriate for research purposes, children consistently prefer the WBS to other self-report instruments. 19 Moreover, the WBS has been specifically validated within the pediatric ED. 21 Some have expressed concern that the WBS may confound a child's affect (e.g., fear, excitement) with pain.
