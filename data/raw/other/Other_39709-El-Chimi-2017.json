        "text": "Aim: To evaluate efficacy and safety of delivery room (DR) sustained lung inflation (SLI) in resuscitation of preterm neonates. Methods: Randomized Controlled Trial including 112 preterm infants randomized to either SLI (n \u00bc 57) using T-piece resuscitator [maximum three inflations with maximum pressure of 30 cmH 2 O for 15 s followed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5-7 cmH 2 O] or conventional bag/mask inflation (CBMI) (n \u00bc 55) using traditional self-inflating bag (maximum pressure of 40 cmH 2 O at a rate of 40-60 per min). Failure was defined as the need for DR or first 72 h intubation. Cord and 2-h post-resuscitation blood samples were collected to measure interleukin (IL)-1b and tumor necrosis factor-a levels before and after intervention. Results: SLI was associated with significantly higher success rate compared to CBMI [75.4 versus 54.5%; p \u00bc 0.017], lower need for DR intubation [5.3% versus 23.6%; (X 2 \u00bc 7.7; p \u00bc 0.005)], higher 5-min-Apgar score (median 8 versus 7; p \u00bc 0.018), shorter duration on nasal-CPAP (p \u00bc 0.017), and non-significantly different air leak (7% versus 11%; p \u00bc 0.3) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates among survivors (2% versus 11%; p \u00bc 0.09). Post-resuscitation IL-1b plasma levels increased significantly in CBMI (p \u00bc 0.009) and not in SLI group. Conclusion: Delivery room SLI is more effective than intermittent bag and mask inflation for improving short-term respiratory outcome in preterm infants, without significant adverse effects.",
