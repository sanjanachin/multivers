        "text": "Background: The Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial (CPIT), which offered financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy showed a clinically and statistically significant improvement in cessation. However, infant birth weight was not seen to be affected. This study reexamines birth weight using an intuitive and a complier average causal effects (CACE) method to uncover important information missed by intention-to-treat analysis. Methods: CPIT offered financial incentives up to \u00a3400 to pregnant smokers to quit. With incentives, 68 women (23.1%) were confirmed non-smokers at primary outcome, compared to 25 (8.7%) without incentives, a difference of 14.3% (Fisher test, p < 0.0001). For this analysis, randomised groups were split into three theoretical subgroups: independent quitters-quit without incentives, hardened smokers-could not quit even with incentives and potential quittersrequired the addition of financial incentives to quit. Viewed in this way, the overall birth weight gain with incentives is attributable only to potential quitters. We compared an intuitive approach to a CACE analysis. Results: Mean birth weight of potential quitters in the incentives intervention group (who therefore quit) was 3338 g compared with potential quitters in the control group (who did not quit) 3193 g. The difference attributable to incentives, was 3338-3193 = 145 g (95% CI \u2212617, +803). The mean difference in birth weight between the intervention and control groups was 21 g, and the difference in the proportion who managed to quit was 14.3%. Since the intervention consisted of the offer of incentives to quit smoking, the intervention was received by all women in the intervention group. However, \"compliance\" was successfully quitting with incentives, and the CACE analysis yielded an identical result, causal birth weight increase 21 g \u00f7 0.143 = 145 g.",

Comparison of those who continued to smoke shows that those in the incentives group had babies with a slightly lower birth weight on average compared with those who continue to smoke in the control group. This indicates that the other variables related to birth weight (that make up the 450 g difference in birth weight between continuing smokers and quitters) were more prevalent in those who were unable to quit in the intervention group. Comparison of those who quit shows that those in the control group were all independent quitters who had other characteristics associated with higher birth weight, whereas some in the intervention group are potential quitters who are likely to have other characteristics that reduce birth weight. Overall comparison of those who continued to smoke and those who quit from both groups shows a 450 g difference in birth weight. Our analysis indicates that only 145 g of the 450 g difference in birth weight between continuing smokers and quitters is due to smoking cessation that takes place after maternity booking. The last comparison shows that overall the offer of incentives to pregnant smokers only increases birth weight by 21 g on average compared with those not offered incentives. Figure 2 illustrates the birth weight of babies born to hardened smokers (those who continued to smoke even when offered incentives to quit -calculated from the intervention group) was 3050 g and the birth weight of babies born to those who independently quit without the offer of incentives (those who quit without incentives -calculated from the control group quitters) was 3600 g. Potential quitters from each group are calculated by removing the above groups' numbers and weights from the overall birth weight of babies in each group and then dividing the overall remaining birth weight of babies in each group by the number of potential quitters (14.3%) for each group (those who quit because of the offer of incentive payments). These calculated values are for potential quitters in each group (in the incentives group women who quit because they were offered incentive payments, in the control group those who did not quit because they were not offered incentive payments). The difference between these two calculated values is 145 g and represents the difference in birth weight caused by the incentive payments offered to quit smoking. The other differences between women are responsible for the further 400 g difference in birth weight between babies born to hardened smokers and independent quitters. These differences may include both characteristics related to smoking such as number of cigarettes smoked per day and partner smoking and other characteristics not directly related to smoking such as maternal deprivation score (as illustrated in Additional file 3: Table S2 reference [11] ).",
