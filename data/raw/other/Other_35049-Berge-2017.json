Material and methods: This was a randomized delayed intervention controlled trial in 67 patients, fulfilling the DSM-5 criteria for specific phobia. All patients received the same CBT performed by dentists specially trained in CBT.

Results: CBT had a significant effect compared to no treatment (WCG). After treatment, the scores on the psychometric self-report scales were significantly reduced and higher levels in the BAT were achieved. The results were maintained at 1-year follow-up.

BII phobia has a complex and multifactorial aetiology. Elements involved in the development and maintenance of the phobia include classical and vicarious conditioning, modelling and negative information. Furthermore, vulnerability factors thought to be involved include genetic influences, aberrant brain processes, temperament, evolutionary preparedness, cognitive biases, disgust and vaso-vagal responses [2] [3] [4] . The vaso-vagal response associated with BII phobia may consequently lead to fainting or near fainting [1, 5] . Intra-oral injections are one of the most fear-provoking stimuli in dental settings [6] , and avoidance of these feared stimuli is frequent. Hence, individuals suffering from this fear might undergo painful dental experiences or choose to avoid necessary dental treatment [7, 8] with reduced dental health as a consequence [9] . A recent questionnaire study among Norwegian 10-to 16-year-olds revealed that 13.9% suffered from high intra-oral injection fear and that 10.6% would avoid necessary dental treatment if an intra-oral injection was required [10] . Missed dental appointments and referrals of patients for dental treatment under general anaesthesia are other possible consequences of high intra-oral injection fear [11, 12] .",

Two clinical psychologists (PhD) with proficiency in using the modified version of ADIS-IV were performing the diagnostic interviews. The psychologists were calibrated prior to the study. A behavioural analysis and psychoeducation were conducted as part of the diagnostic interview. The factors that maintain the phobic behaviour are revealed in addition to the patients catastrophic beliefs. Additionally, at post-waitlist for Group II (WCG), at posttreatment for all participants and at 1 year of follow-up, shorter interviews were performed by the psychologist. At all assessments, the patient underwent a behavioural avoidance test (BAT) [19] , which consisted of 13 hierarchical steps with progressively more difficult exposures to an intra-oral injection ( Table 1 ). The BATs were performed by a group of external dentists who were blinded to the assigned group and assessment point. The dentists had in advance been given an education lecture on how to perform the test, and a written manual describing each step. They were also informed about the rationale and importance of such standardization. Prior to the onset of the test, patients were informed that each step would be verbally explained by the dentist and that they could ask any question during the test. They were additionally ensured that whenever they wanted, the test could be discontinued, either verbally or by showing a 'No' card. Immediately after the test, the patients reported 'Cognitions during the BAT' assessing the frequency of 5 negative and 5 positive thoughts on a 5-point Likert scale (0 \u00bc Never, 4 \u00bc Very often). The negative thoughts included 'I can't do this', 'I'm going to fail', 'I'll faint', 'I need to get out of this situation' and 'I can't stand this'.

The scores on the intra-oral injection fear scale were reduced from larger than the cut-off (38<), indicating a high/clinical level of fear pretreatment, to a level considerably lower than cut-off (19.5) post-treatment [23] . Furthermore, the BAT increased from a mean level of 5.31 pre-treatment (step 5 corresponds to the dentist examining the mouth using the mirror) to 10.58 posttreatment (step 10 corresponds to putting a few drops of anaesthesia), which was considered as a 'successful injection'. The treatment also largely reduced the frequency of negative thoughts. This finding might be interpreted as the treatment is enhancing the experience of having control when undergoing an intra-oral injection and that catastrophic thoughts were reduced. It is supported by the fact that an unknown dentist, not in the position to beforehand build up trust, one of the key elements of the treatment, is conducting the BATs. The results were also maintained at the 1-year follow-up. The scores on the BAT and the IOIF-s support the reliability of the diagnostic interviews. Although the patients did not undergo a full diagnostic interview post-treatment and at the 1-year follow up, the improvements on both self-reported fear and behaviour may imply that the patients no longer met the criteria for an intra-oral injection phobia diagnosis. Furthermore, the fact that 7 out of 10 patients managed to receive intra-oral injections during treatment further consolidated the effectiveness of CBT. It was also important that almost the same proportion of patients in need for further dental treatment, completing the CBT, managed to receive the necessary intra-oral injections at their local dentist.",
