Study design: Using a prospective randomized controlled trial, iron-deficient women with twin gestations were randomized to receive a single or a double dose of daily iron from 16 weeks of gestation until 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was hemoglobin at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included ferritin at 32 weeks, hemoglobin during pregnancy and postpartum, birth weights, preterm birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects, intravenous iron administration, and compliance with treatment. Results: Eighty-five and 87 women were randomized to receive one capsule (group A) or two capsules (group B) of 34 mg of ferrous sulfate, respectively. Mean hemoglobin (9.6 g/dL and 9.7 g/dL) and ferritin (8.6 ng/ml and 8.5 ng/ml) were similar in both groups A and B, respectively, at allocation. Hemoglobin in group B was significantly higher from 32 weeks onward, until 6 weeks postpartum. There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes examined. Conclusions: In twin pregnancies complicated by iron deficiency anemia, doubling the dose of iron increases hemoglobin and ferritin without worsening gastrointestinal side effects.",
