        "text": "Objective: Risk taking, such as heavy alcohol use, is commonplace among adolescents. Nevertheless, prolonged alcohol use at this age can lead to severe health problems. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate a serious game training (''The Fling''), aimed at increasing behavioral control in adolescents and thereby helping them to improve control over their alcohol use. The game training was compared to a game placebo and a nongame training version in a randomized controlled trial. Materials and Methods: A sample of 185 adolescents (mean age 14.9 years) in secondary education participated in the study. They performed four sessions of training, as well as a set of questionnaires and cognitive assessment tasks before and after the training. The basis for the training was the stop-signal paradigm, aimed at increasing behavioral control. Results: The game variants were shown to motivate adolescents beyond the level of the nongame version. Behavioral control improved significantly over time, but this effect was also present in the game placebo, suggesting that the game activities alone may have had a beneficial effect on our measures of behavioral control. As baseline drinking levels were low, no significant training effects on drinking behavior were found. Conclusions: Although the current results are not yet conclusive as to whether ''The Fling'' is effective as a cognitive training, they do warrant further research in this direction. This study also shows that serious games may be uniquely suitable to bridge the gap between an evidence-based training paradigm and an attractive, motivating training environment.",

        "text": "A dolescents often experiment with risky behaviors, such as the use of alcohol. Some, however, experience trouble withstanding the accompanying feelings of temptation and craving, 1 which can turn the relatively innocent experimental behavior into more uncontrolled, problematic behavior. Research has indeed shown that when behavioral control mechanisms are relatively weak (e.g., a poorer ability to plan behavior, inhibit inappropriate responses, or consider alternative response options), the chances of developing a problematic drinking style increase. [2] [3] [4] [5] Uncontrolled, heavy alcohol use at this age can cause immediate health problems as well as academic underperformance, and is an important predictor of addictive behaviors later in life. 6 The good news is that cognitive control processes can successfully be strengthened through the use of cognitive training programs. 7, 8 By applying these programs to an adolescent population, it may be possible to help adolescents to withhold from developing an unhealthy drinking pattern by giving them more control over their alcohol use. However, one problem is that, like many other interventions aimed at reducing adolescents' alcohol use, these training paradigms tend to focus primarily on changing the outcome behavior and not so much on motivating participants to complete the training. Indeed, it has previously been shown that some cognitive training paradigms can be experienced as long and boring. 9 Given that risk groups (i.e., adolescents with behavioral control problems) that could benefit the most from such interventions often have difficulties with concentration and attention, 2 yielding less beneficial training result for the group that needs it the most. Therefore, the continued development of training paradigms that match the motivational needs and skill levels of the target group is of vital importance. One technique that can be used for this purpose is the integration of serious gaming techniques into the training paradigms. Serious games can provide a dynamic environment, tailored to the adolescent's individual level of development, as well as increase participants' motivation to train 10 by using motivating elements such as competition and an arousing game background. 11 Recently, a number of serious games have been developed with exactly this idea in mind: inducing behavioral change through cognitive training, enhanced with motivational elements. [12] [13] [14] In line with these studies, this article presents an evaluation of a serious game (''The Fling''), which was first described in Ref. 14 ''The Fling'' builds on evidence-based training principles 7, [15] [16] [17] aimed at enhancing behavioral control by strengthening both delay of gratification, or the capacity to withstand immediate rewards in favor of bigger long-term rewards, and response inhibition, which means the ability to suppress or delay automatic responses or impulses that might be inappropriate or irrelevant in a certain context.",
