        "text": "To compare the effects of unilateral and bilateral resistance training on single-leg power output, between-limbs imbalance (BLI), bilateral deficit (BLD), change of direction (COD), and linear sprinting and jumping performance in young elite basketball players. Methods: Twenty-two young (U-16-U-19) male basketball players were randomly assigned either to an exclusive unilateral (UNI) (n = 11) or a bilateral (BIL) (n = 11) resistance-training group during a 6-wk period. Both groups training consisted of 3 unilateral or bilateral 90\u00b0 back-squat sets. A postdetermined number of repetitions was set until power output dropped to <10% of maximum power (MP) output. In addition, both groups performed 2 sets of 5 unilateral or bilateral drop jumps and 2 sets of 5 unilateral or bilateral countermovement jumps (CMJ). Pre-and posttraining, performance was assessed by an incremental bilateral and unilateral squat-load test, a multiple-COD test (V-cut test), a 15-m-sprint test (7.5 + 7.5 m) with one 180\u00b0 COD performed with both right (180\u00b0 RCOD) and left (180\u00b0 LCOD) legs, a 25-m-sprint test (5-and 15-m split time), and a CMJ test. Results: Within-group analyses showed substantial improvements in 180\u00b0 RCOD, bilateral and unilateral MP, 25-m-sprint test, and CMJ in both groups. Between-groups analyses showed substantially better results in 180\u00b0 LCOD, MP with right and left legs, BLI, and BLD in UNI than in BIL. Conclusions: Both training programs substantially improved most of the physical-fitness tests, but only UNI reduced between-limbs asymmetry and achieved greater enhancements in actions that mostly required applying force unilaterally in basketball players.",

Despite jumping performance's being considered an important physical-fitness component in most team sports, this is the first study that investigated the effect of unilateral resistance training on CMJ performance in highly trained team-sport players. Therefore, direct comparisons are not possible. The CMJ changes found in the current study after unilateral training (ES = 0.47) are within the range (ES = 0.19-0.79) of previously published reports after different bilateral training strategies in young male team-sport players. 27, [31] [32] [33] In this regard, interventions including bilateral resistance training, complex training, and explosive strength training have typically reported greater training effects (ES = 0.53, 0.62, 0.78) 23, [27] [28] [29] than plyometric training (ES = 0.33) 32 and complex-contrast strength training (ES = 0.19). 27 It should be noted that all studies that found greater training-induced changes in CMJ than in the current study were performed with younger team-sport players (14 vs 17 y) or those more inexperienced in strength training (novices vs 2 y experience). In this regard, it is well known that age and training background can influence the magnitude of training adaptation. 6 Moreover, basketball players are typically required to perform many more jumps during matches and practices than soccer players. As such, it might be possible that this population (basketball players) would have more difficulties in improving vertical-jumping performance.",

While this could be seen as a potential limitation for nonequivalent training volumes, the overall number of repetitions in each condition throughout the training program was similar. However, we cannot know whether the target power-output challenge and/or the provision of instantaneous feedback may have affected the positive results since the conditions were the same for both training groups. It is expected that an unknown training duration (repetitions per set) may have implications on anticipatory/feedforward components (pacing strategies) by means of adjustments in power output. 34 As for feedback provision, even though the literature concerning its long-term effectiveness is scarce, it is believed to be a useful tool to individualize and optimize training interventions by providing a more consistent performance while avoiding repetitions that might produce a negative effect on neuromuscular performance. 35 There are some limitations of this study. It is uncertain whether performance was enhanced through the effect of individualized MP training, the combination of strength and plyometrics, or both training strategies. As such, further studies are warranted to analyze the influence of performing a predetermined versus postdetermined number of repetitions based on a minimum target power and different combinations of resistance-training methods. In addition, more functional tests such as unilateral jumps in different axes or the Star Excursion Balance Test to assess dynamic stability should be included.",
