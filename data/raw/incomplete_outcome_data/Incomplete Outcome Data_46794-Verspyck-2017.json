Methods PPADAL was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between 05/ 2008 and 05/2012 in five French hospitals. The trial included 109 women, aged ! 18 years, with at least one episode of placenta previa bleeding, intact membranes and no other pregnancy complication, at gestational age 24 to 34 weeks and after 48 hours of complete acute tocolysis. Women were randomly allocated to receive either 20 mg of slow-release nifedipine three times daily (n = 54) or placebo (n = 55) until 36 + 6 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome for the trial was length of pregnancy measured in days after enrolment. Main secondary outcomes were rates of recurrent bleeding, cesarean delivery due to hemorrhage, blood transfusion, maternal side effects, gestational age at delivery and adverse perinatal outcomes (perinatal death, chronic lung disease, neonatal sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage > grade 2, perventricular leukomalacia > grade 1, or necrotizing enterocolitis). Analysis was by intention to treat. Results Mean (SD) prolongation of pregnancy was not different between the nifedipine (n = 54) and the placebo (n = 55) group; 42.5 days \u00b1 23.8 versus 44.2 days \u00b1 24.5, p = 0.70. Cesarean due to hemorrhage performed before 37 weeks occurred more frequently in the nifedipine group in comparison with the placebo group (RR, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.72). Adverse perinatal outcomes were comparable between groups; 3.8% for nifedipine",

Placenta previa rate has regularly increased over the last two decades, as has frequency of the associated main risk factors i.e. cesarean section and maternal age [2] . Placenta previa may have considerable consequences for both the mother and the neonate while placing high demands on health resources. High morbidities and mortality rates reported in women are mainly related to severe hemorrhage occurring throughout pregnancy, though mostly at delivery [3] . Perinatal mortality, the rates of which are three to four times higher than in normal pregnancies, frequently occurs in situation of severe prematurity, mainly induced by maternal bleeding [4] . Since the 1980's, conservative expectant management has been advocated as reducing both maternal and neonatal morbidity in preterm bleeding placenta previa [5] . Tocolytic agents is one of the key treatments in conservative management and may be useful in selected cases, enabling better control of uterine activity and reducing blood loss [6, 7] . The rationale for the selective use of tocolytic agents is twofold. In some women, a significant degree of uterine activity is observed during an episode of bleeding. More often, an episode of bleeding may occur following subclinical uterine contractions [8] . As reported treatment protocols can vary in use of tocolytic agents and administration duration, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recently stated that tocolytic agent and optimum regime are still to be determined and further research is needed in this area [6] . Prolonged use of tocolytic therapy has until now been poorly investigated in women with bleeding preterm placenta previa [9] with most publications being retrospective and observational and few data reporting maternal morbidity with severe hemorrhage and neonatal morbidity with prematurity [10, 11] . A systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that calcium channel blockers are preferable to other tocolytic agents (mainly betamimetics) in women at risk of preterm delivery [12] , but no previous study has described calcium channel blockers therapy in symptomatic preterm bleeding placenta previa.

However, poor information on the likelihood of antepartum hemorrhage with treatment decisions and based on placental edge distance is actually available. High rates of antepartum hemorrhage (28.2%) and emergency cesarean section (37%) have been reported in women with placental edge distance from 2.1 to 3.5 cm [21] . In fact, clinical outcomes in women with preterm bleeding placenta i.e. recurrent or heavy bleeding, emergency delivery for hemorrhage, and premature delivery could be highly variable and mostly irrespective of the degree of placenta [22] . Interestingly, few women with placental edge distance from 2.1 to 3.0 cm were included in our trial. In addition, placental migration rates are more frequently observed during the third trimester in women with low lying placenta in comparison with women with placenta overlapping or reaching the internal os [23] . We therefore included women with low lying placenta and also decided to prolong tocolytic therapy until 36 weeks + 6 so as to reduce recurrent bleeding events with significant placental migrations and therefore improve overall maternal outcomes. However, our finding cannot exclude a deleterious hemorrhagic impact related to nifedipine therapy in preterm bleeding placenta and particularly in women with placental edge below 20 mm from the internal os. Further studies are still needed to determine the best tocolytic agent women with preterm moderate bleeding placenta previa. An increased rate of late preterm neonates was observed in the nifedipine group and was most likely attributable to cesarean section due to hemorrhage and/or recurrent bleeding.",
