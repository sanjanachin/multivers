        "text": "Background: Fatty fish is the dominant dietary source of n-3 LCPUFAs but it also contains other micronutrients considered important for brain development and function. To our knowledge, the effect of fatty fish intake on cognitive function in adolescents has not been investigated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) previously. The aim of the present trial was to investigate whether consumption of fatty fish meals three times per week for 12 weeks could alter attention performance in adolescents compared to similar meals with meat or n-3 LCPUFA supplements. Methods: In the Fish Intervention Studies-TEENS (FINS-TEENS), adolescents from eight secondary schools (n = 426; age: 14-15y) were individually randomized. Attention performance was assessed with the d2 test of attention. Differences between groups from pre to post intervention were assessed with linear mixed effect models and general estimates equation. The fish group was set as reference. Dietary compliance was recorded for each meal throughout the trial and controlled for in the adjusted analyses. Results: The improvement in processing speed was significantly lower in the meat (\u221211.8; 95% CI:-23.3, \u22120.4) and supplement (\u221213.4; 95% CI:-24.9, \u22121.8) group compared to the fish group (reference). The supplement group also showed inferior improvement in total performance (\u221210.4; 95% CI:-20.0, \u22120.7) compared to the fish group (reference). The results were slightly affected when controlling for dietary compliance. Omission errors decreased in the meat group compared to the fish group (Incidence rate ratio = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.98), but the difference disappeared when controlling for dietary compliance. Conclusions: We observed a small beneficial effect of fatty fish, compared to meat meals and supplements on processing speed. However, these results are difficult to interpret due to low dietary compliance. This study shows that different taste preferences among participants is challenging in intervention trials with food. A prospective cohort design may be a better alternative when studying diet in the future. Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT02350322.",

The intervention lasted for 3 months and included fish approximately once per week. Contrary to our results, no effects were observed on neither TN nor TN-E compared to the control group. They found that the percentages of E1 and E2 errors were higher after the intervention compared to the control period, when the children ate their usual packed lunch [16] . However, this is not in accordance with the decrease in E1 errors that we found in the meat group in the present study. Our findings in TN (and TN-E, which seems to be driven by TN) suggests that there could be a link between fish intake and the speed of processing information. To our best of knowledge, no other RCTs have examined the effects of fish intake on attention or processing speed in healthy young subjects. However, although not directly comparable to our sample of adolescents, two crosssectional studies in middle-aged adults (45-70 y, n = 1613) [27] and elderly (70-74y, n = 2031) [28] reported positive associations between fish consumption and cognitive speed, motor speed and attention. Some studies have also been conducted in adolescents, using other cognitive outcomes than attention or processing speed. Kim et al. [14] found a positive association between the reported fish intake and average school grades in Swedish adolescents (15 y, n = 9448). The association seemed to be dose-dependent between the number of times the respondent reported to consume fish [14] . \u00c5berg et al. [13] used questionnaire data from male respondents in the same study and linked them with records on intelligence test performance at age 18, collected at the Swedish Military Conscription Register (n = 3972). These data showed that fish consumption at age 15 was Data are given as mean \u00b1 SD or n (%).

Finally, De Groot et al. [15] found no association between fish consumption and attention problems, which cannot be directly compared to the d2 test of attention measure, in Dutch adolescents (12-18 y, n = 700). However, they found an inverted u-shape association between fish intake and more advanced vocabulary and higher end term grades, showing that Table 3 Predicted change in d2 outcomes after intervention with fish (n = 137), meat (n = 148), n-3 supplements (n = 141) eating fish was beneficial, but eating more fish than recommended (defined as~450 mg/d EPA + DHA) no longer seemed to be effective [15] . We did not have a pure placebo group, and thus, it is not possible to separate the effects of the intervention from a learning effect that may have occurred from conducting the same test twice. However, since a learning effect should be equally distributed in the groups, the effect of one intervention over the other(s) should be detectable when comparing the groups against each other. Our results are difficult to interpret, because the beneficial effect in the fish group on TN and TN-E was observed even among those with very low dietary compliance. This makes it difficult to conclude on the relationship between fish intake and performance in TN and TN-E. The significant decrease of omission (E1) errors in the meat group compared to fish in the crude analyses is also inconclusive, because it disappeared when adjusting for dietary compliance.",
