        "text": "Background: Depression often starts in adolescence making it an ideal time to intervene. We developed a universal cognitive behavioural therapy-based programme (MEMO CBT) to be delivered via multimedia mobile phone messages for teens. Methods: We conducted a prospective multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial in 15 high schools in Auckland, New Zealand, comparing MEMO CBT with a control programme [MEMO control] matched for intensity and type of message but with alternative content not targeting depression. The primary outcome was the change in score on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores in the self-reported Reynold's Adolescent Depression Rating Scale-Second Edition, the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire, suicidal ideation using selected items from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, the Pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire, 12-month period prevalence of the diagnosis of depressive disorder using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and students' ratings of their satisfaction with the programme. Results: Eight hundred and fifty-five students (13-17 years old, mean 14.3 years) were randomly assigned to MEMO CBT (426) or to MEMO Control (429). Participants (68% female) had a mean CDRS-R at baseline of 21.5 (SD: 5). Overall 394 (93%) from the intervention group and 392 (91%) from the control group were followed up at 12 months. At the end of the intervention (approximately 9 weeks) the mean CDRS-R scores were 20.8 in the intervention group versus 20.4 in the control group, and at 12 months they were 22.4 versus 22.4 (p value for difference in change from baseline = 0.3). There was no obvious association between the amount of the intervention viewed by participants and outcomes. Conclusions: There was no evidence of benefit from the mobile phone CBT intervention compared with a control programme. Universal depression prevention remains a challenge.",

All students were invited to participate. Those students who were interested were asked to join a small group discussion led by a research assistant to provide more details. All participants were given (Reynolds, 2000) . The baseline RADS-2 data were entered at the study centre within 24 hr and students identified as having current depressive symptoms (score of 76 or higher on the self-completed RADS-2 and/or a high score on four out of the six critical items) and/or at risk of self-harm (question 14 on RADS-2) were immediately referred for assessment and management by the school guidance counsellors. These students were excluded from the study unless the more detailed clinical assessment showed that depression or risk of self-harm was not of clinical concern. Eligible students were then invited to individual interviews with trained research assistants. Interviews lasted approximately 30 min and were conducted during school time in school offices/rooms. The research assistants administered the Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R; Poznanski & Mokros, 1996) and questions from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS) (Brener et al., 2002) on self-harm. Participants also completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ-LES-Q; Endicott, Nee, Yang, & Wohlberg, 2006) and the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ; Kent, Vostanis, & Feehan, 1997) . If any additional students reported clinically significant symptoms of depression (CDRS-R T score >65) or high suicide risk (CDRS-R question 13 score of 5 or above, or any positive answer to relevant YRBS items) at the interview, the young person was referred to a school counsellor immediately. All other participants were eligible to participate and were randomised. The interview process was repeated postintervention (approximately 9 weeks after baseline) and again at 12-month follow-up. Any students identified at high risk of a depressive disorder or suicide ideation/behaviour during the study (after randomisation) were referred to the school guidance counsellor for additional support and intervention but were not excluded from the study.

Clearly it is harder to show a treatment effect if most of the target population were well throughout the trial. There were also a number of differences in approach required for the mobile phone.
