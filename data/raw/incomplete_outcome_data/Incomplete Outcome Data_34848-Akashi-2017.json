        "text": "Background: Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies in young children. While oral immunotherapy (OIT) is not routinely recommended in current guidelines, it has been considered as a potential alternative treatment strategy. Studies on OIT for food allergy have been explored, but no controlled trials have been reported in Japan. Methods: The first oral food challenge (OFC) was performed before treatment to ensure diagnosis and evaluate the threshold dose for egg using the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. Participants were randomly assigned by computerized algorithm to receive OIT using egg (OIT group) or no egg (egg elimination [EE] group). A second OFC was performed in both groups approximately 6 months after therapy. Blood samples were collected and egg white-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E and IgG4 were measured before and after the treatment period. Results: Eight of the 14 patients (57%) in the OIT group had no allergic reaction to 4 g dry egg powder whereas none of the 16 patients in the EE group did. All 14 patients in the OIT group had increased threshold for egg powder in the second OFC compared with baseline. There was no significant change in egg white-specific IgE level during therapy. After therapy, egg white-specific IgG4 increased significantly in the OIT group, but not in the EE group. Conclusion: OIT is effective in increasing the threshold for allergens and inducing desensitization in Japanese egg allergy patients, similarly to North American and European patients. Key words children, egg allergy, immunoglobulin G4, oral immunotherapy, randomized controlled trial. Egg is one of the leading causes of childhood food allergy. In Japan, the prevalence for immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated egg allergy is 1-4% in young children. 1 In the USA, that is approximately 2.6% by 2.5 years of age. 2 The management strategy described in current local guidelines and other countries advises avoidance of egg intake. Such a practice, however, relies heavily on the discipline of the patients and their caregivers, and may limit quality of life. 3,4 To that end, oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been explored as a new treatment strategy. 5 Several lines of evidence have shown that OIT is successful in desensitizing patients who are allergic to cow's milk, peanuts and egg. 6-15 Recent randomized controlled studies (RCT) have also demonstrated that a high proportion of the patients with egg allergy acquired desensitization via OIT. 16-19 These studies, however, focused mainly on patients in Europe and the USA. In Japan, although there have been clinical trials, most did not have control groups. 20 The aim of this study was therefore to carry out the first RCT of OIT for eggallergic patients in Japan. Methods Subjects Participants were recruited from patients who had been followed via scheduled visits to the outpatient unit at the National Center for Child Health and Development in Tokyo. The inclusion criteria were: (i) age 3-15 years; (ii) complete elimination of eggs from the diet; (iii) egg-specific IgE \u2265 0.7 U A /mL (CAP system; Phadia, Tokyo, Japan); (iv) positive immediate allergic reaction on double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) for eggs performed after admission to hospital; and (v) patient and caregiver desire to join this study.
