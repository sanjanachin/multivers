Methods: Patients were assessed for eligibility, and those who met the requirements and agreed to participate were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly allocated into 3 groups, depending on the type of expansion. The tooth-borne group (n 5 16; ages, 12.63 6 1.36 years) had RME with a tooth-borne appliance; the bone-borne group (n 5 16; ages, 12.92 6 1.07 years) had RME with a bone-borne appliance; and the hybrid group (n 5 15; ages, 13.41 6 0.88 years) had RME with hybrid appliances. Dentoalveolar effects were evaluated by digitally superimposed 3-dimensional scans of maxillary dental casts on a coordinate system and linear interdental width measurements of mandibular dental casts in the pretreatment, posttreatment, and postretention periods. For intragroup and intergroup comparisons, 1-way analysis of variance for repeated measures and multivariate analysis of variance were performed, respectively. Results: Similar dentoalveolar treatment effects were achieved in all groups with the exception of a small amount of expansion on the right side in the bone-borne group. Conclusions: All 3 expanders led to the expansion of maxillary dentoalveolar structures with mild relapse. However, the amount of expansion of the bone-borne expander on the right side was statistically lower. Spontaneous interdental expansion was observed in the mandibular dentitions in all groups.",

A loss of stability in the bone-borne RME device by tongue movements and pressure in the BBG was mentioned by some patients. In RME treatment, rotational movement of the maxillary halves occurs due to 2 centers of rotation, which are located at the frontonasal suture from the frontal view and at the posterior of the midpalatal suture in the third molar area, from the occlusal view. 22 A pyramid-shaped expansion-ie, widening in the anterior region and base, narrowing as the midpalatal suture goes superiorly and posteriorly-has been produced in both the frontal and occlusal views of the suture. 23, 24 In this study, the maxillary central incisors extruded, retracted, and moved distally with the maxillary halves; this is the result of rotational expansion movement, except for UR1-x in the BBG. This retraction movement occurred because of the triangular-shaped opening movement of the maxillary halves that was wider in the anterior region. Because the palate region is reliable in the superimposition method of 3D digital maxillary models, even in patients treated with RME, this soft tissue area remains stable during opening of the maxillary halves, but the bony structures do not. 21 With this expansion movement, the bony structures of the maxillary halves and accompanying structures such as teeth move distally and posteriorly, resulting in the retracted position of the maxillary incisors compared with the initial positions in the occlusal view (Fig 6 [F6-4/C] ). In the retention period, the retracted position of the maxillary central incisors persisted during their mesialization (relapse). Extrusion was obtained in the maxillary central incisors. In a finite element method study, Jafari et al 25 showed that the lateral structures moved upward, whereas the midline structures and the maxillary incisors were displaced downward after RME because of rotation of the nasomaxillary complex. The effects of both appliances on the maxillary central incisors were statistically similar (Table III) . This result agrees with the literature. 7, 26 However, Lagrav ere et al 7 did not report the retraction of maxillary central incisors in a study in which the skeletal and dentoalveolar differences were evaluated together on cone-beam computed tomography images.

        "text": "For the maxillary first premolars, expansion was obtained in all groups. In the intergroup differences, the amount of buccal movement of the right first premolar (UR4B-x, UR4P-x) in the BBG was statistically lower than in the TBG at T1 and T2. Due to the design of the tooth-borne appliance in the TBG, the expansion effect could be easily reflected onto the dentition via its tooth support. 4 Intragroup differences showed that, in the TBG, the obtained expansion movement at T1 was slightly continued at T2. In the retention period, the rigid tooth-borne device maintained the obtained expansion width with tooth supports. During the retention period, the maxillary base had a narrowing tendency with relapse, but the tooth supports of the device could not move because of their rigidity. The lingual root movement of tooth supports combined with the narrowing of the apical base led to a slight buccal crown tipping. Buccal tipping of tooth supports increased the interpremolar width at the dental level and probably acted as if the expansion continued at T2. When the rotational movements of the maxillary first premolars were assessed in the TBG, it was seen that the first premolars that were cemented to the bands of device did not move with the triangular-shaped opening movement of apical base. Moreover, they rotated in the reverse direction during expansion. In the retention period, a slight relapse took place ( ). These results were similar to those in the literature. 26 In the BBG, the first premolars moved with the maxillary apical base during expansion (Fig 6) . Lee et al 26 reported mesial and intrusion movements, which were dissimilar to our results. In the HG, the first premolars probably moved with the maxillary apical base during expansion (Fig 6) . Rotational expansion of the maxilla in the vertical dimension and alveolar bending could be the reasons for the extrusion movement of the palatinal cusp tip of maxillary first premolars. During RME, alveolar bending/tipping and dental tipping have been reported. 27 These results agree with the literature. 5 In our study, expansion was obtained for the maxillary first molars (UR6MB-x, UR6MP-x, UL6MB-x, UL6MP-x) in all groups. The alterations in buccal movement on the right side in the BBG were statistically significant (P \\0.01), but small (UR6MB-x, 0.80 mm; UR6MP-x, 0.67 mm). In the intergroup differences, the amount of expansion movement of the maxillary right first molar in the transversal plane in the BBG was statistically lower than in the other groups (Table III) . This difference increased during the retention period. The individual expansion capacity of the cranial sutures may be the reason for asymmetric expansion. 28 Furthermore, the design of the bone-borne device may not be sufficient to expand deeply locked posterior teeth caused by a crossbite, because of the lack of tooth support.",
