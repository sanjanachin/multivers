        "text": "Background: In the United States, 17% of children are currently obese. Increasing feelings of fullness may prevent excessive energy intake, lead to better diet quality, and promote long-term maintenance of healthy weight. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a fullness-rating tool (aim 1) and to determine whether a high-protein (HP), high-fiber (HF), and combined HP and HF (HPHF) breakfast increases preschoolers\u00d5 feelings of fullness before (pre) and after (post) breakfast and pre-lunch, as well as their diet quality, as measured by using a composite diet quality assessment tool, the Revised Children\u00d5s Diet Quality Index (aim 2). Methods: Children aged 4 and 5 y (n = 41; 22 girls and 19 boys) from local Head Start centers participated in this randomized intervention trial. Sixteen percent of boys and 32% of girls were overweight or obese. After the baseline week, children rotated through four 1-wk periods of consuming ad libitum HP (19-20 g protein), HF (10-11 g fiber), HPHF (19-21 g protein, 10-12 g fiber), or usual (control) breakfasts. Food intake at breakfast was estimated daily, and for breakfast, lunch, and snack on day 3 of each study week Student\u00d5s t tests and ANOVA were used to determine statistical differences. Results: Children\u00d5s post-breakfast and pre-lunch fullness ratings were $1 point higher than those of pre-breakfast (aim 1). Although children consumed, on average, 65 kcal less energy during the intervention breakfasts (P < 0.007) than during the control breakfast, fullness ratings did not differ (P = 0.76). Relative to the control breakfast, improved diet quality (12%) was calculated for the HP and HF breakfasts (P < 0.027) but not for the HPHF breakfast (aim 2). Conclusions: Post-breakfast fullness ratings were not affected by the intervention breakfasts relative to the control breakfast. HP and HF breakfasts resulted in higher diet quality. Serving HP or HF breakfasts may be valuable in improving diet quality without lowering feelings of satiation or satiety. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02122224.",

One possible way to decrease excess energy intake may be to increase feelings of fullness. Fullness reflects satiation and satiety. Satiation refers to feelings that will increase during an eating occasion and eventually prompt the cessation of that eating occasion (feeling full at the end of the snack or meal), whereas satiety refers to the feelings initiated at the end of an eating occasion and continuing through the intermeal period (13) . Results from parent reports (14, 15) suggest that children who are overweight or obese have decreased satiety responses compared with children of average weight.

Study procedures were conducted in the classroom and followed the usual schedule of activities: snack at 0900, lunch between 1130 and 1200, naptime, and snack at 1430. On the first day of the study, all children in the classroom listened to a short (;5 min) story about the differences between having an ''empty tummy'' compared with having a ''full tummy.'' The story was read in English and Spanish, when appropriate, and introduced the labeling of the feelings associated with an ''empty versus full tummy.'' The story was followed by application exercises as visual examples of fictitious characters who had eaten different amounts of food were shown, and the children were asked to describe if the character\u00d5s ''tummy'' was feeling empty or full and the estimated magnitude of the feeling (a little or very). Children responded verbally or pointed to the silhouettes of ''empty'' and ''full.'' Within 5 min of the beginning and the end of lunch, children were shown the pictures of the silhouettes and research staff first asked ''How does your tummy feel right now? Does it feel empty or full?'' as the staff member pointed to each silhouette. After the child responded, he or she was then asked, ''Does your tummy feel a little empty/full, or very empty/full?'' Although the questions were read in order, the prompting of the reply ''empty or full'' and ''a little or very'' was used at random, often triggered by the participant pointing to the response before the sentence with the question had been completed.",
