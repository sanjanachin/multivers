In children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), very little is known about how skills are transferred from training situations to real life contexts. In this study we examined the influence of two types of practice on transfer of motor skills acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Method One hundred and eleven children with DCD and their typically developing (TD) peers, aged 6-10 years (M = 8.0 SD = 1.0) were randomly assigned to either variable (n = 56) or repetitive practice (n = 55). Participants in the repetitive practice played the same exergame (ski slalom) twice weekly for 20 minutes, over a period of 5 weeks, while those in the variable group played 10 different games. Motor skills such as balance tasks (hopping), running and agility tasks, ball skills and functional activities were evaluated before and after 5 weeks of training. Results ANOVA repeated measures indicated that both DCD and TD children demonstrated transfer effects to real life skills with identical and non-identical elements at exactly the same rate, irrespective of the type of practice they were assigned to.",

Although the games were selected on the presence of whole body movements, half of the children had, to a certain extent, some control over their training sessions, depending on which group they were in. In this study, we have demonstrated that playing active video games provides positive transfer effects on balance tasks (hopping), running and agility tasks and functional activities such as long jump, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. Similarly, we have shown when dynamic balance tasks are trained with exergames, it also leads to some improvements in ball skills. Importantly, we showed that transfer was not better for participants in the variable practice schedule compared to participants in the repetitive protocols. Although our findings were unexpected, we are not the only ones who found that variable practice does not always lead to better transfer. In a 2002 review, Wulf and Shea questioned the generalizability of results from studies using simple laboratory tasks to the learning of complex motor skills, especially in relatively young children. In cases of high attention, memory and motor demands, they argued that indiscriminate training may overload the system and thus disrupt the potential benefits of random practice. Blocked or repetitive training might be more effective, especially early in the learning process. Obviously, the novelty factor reduces faster during the repetitive protocol compared to the variable protocol, but the similar transfer and scores on enjoyment suggests that there was no effect (yet) after five weeks. A certain level of experience may be required for variable training to become more effective than blocked or repetitive training. Also the rules for transfer of learning may be different between children and adults, or for experts and novices in more complex tasks. [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] .",

This result indicates that playing exergames could lead to motor skills transfer from practiced skills (balance and agility) to unpracticed skills (object control). Although the effect size of the change in aiming and catching (0.38) is smaller than for balance (0.46), this seems partly at odds with the theories of training specificity and identical elements. While the MABC-2 items aiming, and catching are very static, anticipation to moving objects and postural adjustments to fast moving body parts were trained in both training protocols. The indissoluble relation between balance and postural control may have led to improvements in fast postural changes and response time, which are key requirements for aiming and catching. Moreover, an enhanced ability to extract goalrelevant task characteristics would allow players to better predict upcoming events and to allocate perceptual and cognitive resources in a manner to take advantage of those predictions. To a certain extent, it is possible that the children improved in anticipatory control, sensory information processing capacities (both visual and auditory), and attention focus resulting in transfer effect even across untrained skills. The visual pursuit of the avatar during the games, which also requires sustained visual attention, could have led to small beneficial effects on manual dexterity tasks in children with DCD.
