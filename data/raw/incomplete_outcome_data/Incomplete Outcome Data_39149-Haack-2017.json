We analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial investigating the efficacy of a multicomponent psychosocial intervention (Child Life and Attention Skills, CLAS, n = 74) in comparison to Parent-Focused Treatment (PFT, n = 74) and treatment as usual (TAU, n = 51) for youth with ADHD-I (average child age = 8.6 years, range 7-11 years, 58 % boys). Child and parent/family functioning were assessed prior to treatment, immediately following treatment, and at follow-up into the subsequent school year using parent and teacher reports of inattention, organization, social skills, academic competency (teachers only), parenting daily hassles, and positive and negative parenting behaviors (parents only). Both treatment groups improved on negative parenting and home impairment, but only CLAS families also improved on positive parenting as well as academic impairment. Improvements in positive and negative parenting mediated treatment effects on child impairment independent of improvements in child inattention, implicating parenting as an important mechanism of change in psychosocial treatment for ADHD-I. Further, whereas parent-focused training produces improvements in negative parenting and impairment at home for children with ADHD-I, a multicomponent approach (incorporating child skills training and teacher consultation) more consistently produces improvements at school and in positive parenting, which may contribute to improvements in social skills into the next school year.",

Children with ADHD-I often present with passive, lethargic attention problems, which may be accompanied by a sluggish cognitive tempo (e.g., getting lost in thought, losing train of thought; Carlson and Mann 2002; Garner et al. 2010; McBurnett et al. 2014; Mueller et al. 2014) . At school and during homework, these children experience difficulties with academic enablers (i.e., engagement and motivation) and with organization; they also have an elevated risk of learning difficulties compared to children without ADHD (Bauermeister et al. 2005; Faraone et al. 2015; Massetti et al. 2008; Milich et al. 2001) . In social interactions, children with ADHD-I frequently are described as shy, withdrawn, deficient in social knowledge, and neglected by peers (Bauermeister et al. 2005; Milich et al. 2001; Solanto et al. 2009) .

The dynamic and bidirectional relation between parenting and child behavior (Bell 1968; Belsky 1984; Patterson 1982) suggests that less effective parenting may elicit negative child behavior, which in turn elicits the use of less effective parenting. Indeed, a recent study examining cross-sectional associations and pathways between child ADHD symptoms, parenting, and functional impairment in a sample of children with ADHD-I (Haack et al. in press) suggested that both child inattention and parenting behaviors were independently associated with the severity and type of functional child impairment. Results also indicated that both positive and negative parenting were related to social impairment, whereas only negative parenting was linked to academic and home impairment. If positive and negative parenting influence functional impairment above and beyond the influence of child ADHD symptoms per se, it would provide a rationale for targeting both parenting and child symptoms in treatment.",

Specifically, we predicted that families receiving either psychosocial treatment would demonstrate statistically significant immediate and sustained improvement in parenting (i.e., positive and negative parenting behaviors) and child impairment at home (i.e., parenting daily hassles), relative to families assigned to TAU-and that families in CLAS would exhibit greater improvement on academic impairment than TAU 1 (i.e., academic enablers). Our second hypothesis (Hypothesis 2) was that improvements in parenting behavior would mediate significant intervention gains for the following: (1) parent-reported impairment outcomes at post-treatment (i.e., organizational skills, social skills, and daily hassles), (2) teacher-reported impairment outcomes at post-treatment (i.e., academic enablers, organizational skills, and social skills), and 3parent-reported impairment-related outcomes at followup (i.e., organizational skills, social skills, and daily hassles).",

Strategies covered included attending, using rewards and positive consequences such as praise, establishing daily routines, using effective directions and commands, using prudent negative consequences, avoiding power struggles, parent stress management, and organizing/structuring the home and the child's broader environment to promote adaptive functioning and independence. To address executive functioning deficits (e.g., planning, working memory, multitasking, prioritizing), we taught parents to closely scaffold their child through use of routines across the day (e.g., morning, homework time, evening) and other cue-based reminders (e.g., lists of tasks to be completed), organizational strategies, and feedback and contingencies to reinforce successful implementation of day-to-day activities and tasks.

Both skill knowledge deficits and skill implementation deficits were targeted through didactic instruction, modeling of skills by group leaders, behavioral rehearsal, corrective feedback, and in vivo practice in the context of a reward-based contingency management program.

Role-plays of common problem scenarios for ADHD-I were covered as a part of each module (e.g., staying on task during homework, staying focused when getting ready in the morning, joining a game, responding to being teased). Children practiced new skills during play activities and mock school/home routines. For example, children rotated through mock homework stations and morning routine relay races and participated in backpack organization challenges. Each week, children brought in stars earned from their home and school challenges in exchange for group-based rewards (e.g., mid-treatment cookie party, pizza party at the last session) designed to facilitate generalization of behaviors. For children who were not meeting the behavioral demands of the child group (e.g., following directions), individualized reward programs were developed to reinforce appropriate behavior during the group.

Subsequently, up to four additional Classroom Challenge meetings were offered, during which methods for increasing the effectiveness and success of the Classroom Challenge were discussed, along with a broader range of accommodations (e.g., preferential seating, using a homework planner, timers and/or reminders) intended to improve attention and reduce classroom impairment.
