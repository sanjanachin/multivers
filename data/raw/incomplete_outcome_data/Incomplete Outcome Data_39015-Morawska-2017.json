Methods A 2 (Triple P-Positive Parenting Program vs. care as usual) by 3 (baseline, postintervention, 6-month follow-up) design was used, with random group assignment. Of 107 families, 51.4% (N \u00bc 55) had a father participate alongside the child's mother, who was the primary intervention target. Fathers completed questionnaires assessing illness-related child behavior problems; self-efficacy with illness management and illness-related child behavior problems; and health-related quality of life. Results Secondary intent-to-treat analyses indicated improved child behavior and self-efficacy for managing eczema, but not asthma. Health-related quality of life improved for children, but not parents/families. There were no other significant intervention effects. Conclusions Intervention outcomes were positive for eczema but not asthma, and did not depend on the extent of father participation in the intervention.",

The content of the sessions draws on the theoretical principles that form the basis of the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program (Sanders, 2012) , and is designed to be interactive and provide opportunities for discussion among participating parents. The first session focused on providing parents with strategies that empower them to prevent and manage illness problems and ensure their children are implementing their illness prevention and management plan appropriately. The second session was designed as an introduction to the principles of positive parenting in the context of child chronic illness management, to promote positive parenting practices, assist parents to develop effective disciplinary methods, and help create environments conducive to caring relationships between parents and their children. It began with a discussion of why children with a chronic illness may be at risk of behavior problems, before examining common parenting traps from the perspective of parenting a child with a chronic illness, followed by assertive discipline strategies. As most groups had a mix of participants with one or both conditions, strategy examples and exercises were tailored for both conditions. Tailoring was driven by the expressed needs of each group and was gauged with an introductory exercise about specific challenges experienced. For example, when discussing ways to involve the child in their treatment, examples were tailored depending on the child's age and health condition (e.g., for a preschooler with eczema, involvement might include asking the child about next steps and talking about colors of creams, while for the older child with asthma, involvement might include having the child take more of a lead role in setting up required equipment). In total, 18 discussion groups were held at a university psychology clinic in metropolitan Brisbane, Australia, between August 2011 and May 2013. Groups were facilitated by 10 accredited Triple P practitioners (psychologists/nurses). Groups comprised an average six parents (M \u00bc 6.56, SD \u00bc 3.54) from four families (M \u00bc 4.44, SD \u00bc 2.60), and a mix of intervention and waitlist CAU participants (who had completed their T3 assessment) and fathers and mothers attended the sessions.

There is some evidence in the literature that attendance by both parents potentiates intervention effects (Bagner & Eyberg, 2003; Lundahl, Tollefson, Risser, & Lovejoy, 2008) , and while we did not test this directly, these results suggest that at least in the context of childhood chronic illness having the father also attend sessions does not lead to greater improvements. This could reflect a number of issues, including a greater maternal responsibility for child care (Craig & Mullan, 2011) and better engagement of mothers in the parenting intervention compared with fathers (i.e., higher session attendance and questionnaire completion). It may also be the case that in our sample, where both parents agreed to be involved (at least by completing assessment), there was already good communication between parents, and information was shared effectively with nonattending fathers. Recent studies have suggested that better couple relationships and communication result in good outcomes from parenting intervention regardless of father attendance (Huntington & Vetere, 2016) , suggesting that in these cases, mothers are able to effectively share the learned knowledge and skills with their partners. In such cases, parents may make decisions about who will attend based on whom they feel will derive the most benefit, taking into account the practicalities of family life. It is also possible that the intervention simply did not meet fathers' needs in the same way as it did for mothers. While intervention satisfaction scores were comparable (48.5/70 vs. 51.0/70 for fathers vs. mothers), lower engagement in both session attendance and completion of assessment may indicate that fathers did not value the program as highly, or see it as a good fit for their parenting. Future studies should explore not only outcomes for fathers, but also their perceptions of the utility and fit of the program to their parenting needs.",

First, the sample size was small and analyses were under-powered, reflecting the fact that the overall trial was powered for the target parents (i.e., mothers) rather than the sub-group of fathers. A sample of 128 fathers would have been required to detect a medium effect size on the variables of interest. While there were no differences between fathers who attended sessions versus those who did not, it is possible that there are systematic differences between families where both parents choose to attend an intervention compared with those who do not, although in this study we did not find baseline differences between families where fathers did or did not agree to participate. The present study did not assess fathers' involvement in their child's routine medical management, beyond ascertaining that they were not primarily responsible for it; moreover, a small sample size precluded assessment of the effect of the degree of father involvement in the intervention on child behavior outcomes. Given there is some evidence that attendance by both parents potentiates effects (Bagner & Eyberg, 2003; Lundahl et al., 2008) , examining the additional benefit of having both versus one parent attend, and the characteristics of families who are most likely to benefit from having both parents attend, would be an important next step in parenting intervention research. Finally, in this study, we relied only on fathers' reports and did not collect independent reports of fathers' parenting.",
