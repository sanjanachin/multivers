        "text": "Background: Surgical stress index (SSI) is an established indicator for intraoperative nociception. Opioids are used to block stimulus of cranial pinning in neurosurgery. We investigated the effect of different infusion rates of sufentanil on SSI during cranial pinning in children under general anaesthesia. Methods: Forty-nine children (2-12 years of age) underwent neurosurgery with pinning. The children were randomized into three groups based on the rate of sufentanil infusion: 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 \u03bcg\u2022kg \u22121 \u2022hr. \u22121. Continuous sufentanil infusion began following neuromuscular blockade administration, at a rate determined by each patient's assigned treatment group. Following preparation for surgery, cranial pinning was performed. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, along with heart rate and photoplethysmographic data, were continuously recorded from 1 min prior to cranial pinning through 5 min after cranial pinning, in 1-min intervals. SSI was calculated following the completion of surgery. Differences in measured outcomes over time among the three groups were evaluated using a generalized estimation equation. Differences in pinning outcomes in the same group were evaluated with Freidman test. Results: We found no statistical differences in long-term SSI that were associated with different infusion rates of sufentanil during cranial pinning. Blood pressures in all groups increased for 2 min after cranial pinning, and then decreased; we found no statistical difference in long-term blood pressure values among the groups. Heart rate increased after pinning in the group that received a low-dose infusion of sufentanil. Conclusions: Since SSI was intended to measure the blunting effects of sufentanil towards the noxious stimulus of cranial pinning, our results suggest that SSI might not be sufficiently sensitive to monitor the nociceptive response in children.",

It reflects the patient's responses, which result from increased sympathetic activity as a reaction to nociceptive stimuli. A previous study showed that multiple stress indicators (SSI, PPGA, HR, BP, response entropy and state entropy) succeeded in detecting the nociceptive stimulus caused by intubation and surgery in anaesthetized children [19] . These findings indicated a clinical use for SSI during general anaesthesia in children, suggesting that SSI might be useful as an indicator of nociceptive stimulus. Therefore, we hypothesized that, if high dose of opioid could block the nociceptive stimulus, a patient's SSI might remain stable in the presence of a high opioid dose; in contrast, a low dose of opioid would not prevent changes in SSI. Here, we compared different infusion rates of opioid (sufentanil) with SSI values, along with traditional parameters such as BP and HR, to measure nociceptive response. We used cranial pinning as the nociceptive stimulus during general anaesthesia. However, we found no differences in SSI values in the presence of differing infusion rates of sufentanil, in contrast to the previous study; however, other traditional parameters might vary over time during cranial pinning. In our study, BP changed with the cranial pinning stimulus, demonstrating an increase at 1 and 2 min after cranial pinning in all groups; subsequently, BP decreased. Importantly, this finding was consistent with a previous study [20] . However, SSI did not follow this trend, thereby demonstrating that SSI measurements and traditional clinical findings were quite disparate. This can be explained in multiple ways. First, the algorithm to calculate SSI is based on a 'normalized' PPGA wave (67% included in the final index) and pulse beat interval (PBI, 33%); however, this algorithm is proprietary and does not include BP [21] , which may explain the lack of differences seen in SSI. Another possible explanation is that there is an uncertainty in SSI due to the nociceptive response in children. Lastly, we checked BP and averaged SSI, both in 1 min intervals. Therefore, we might have missed changes in SSI by averaging the SSI values, which were calculated every 8 s, even though the noxious stimulus of cranial pinning was very short. Interestingly, HR increased in low-dose infusion of sufentanil, unlike in the other two groups, despite there being no differences among the three groups.",

These differences might be explained by factors that influence BP and HR. Notably, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, arterial stiffness and clinical states are factors that influence BP.

As the algorithm to calculate SPI is essentially the same as that used to calculate SSI, findings from studies that use SPI might be applicable to the results in our present study. A previous study showed that SPI had moderate correlation with stress hormones during anaesthesia, thereby indicating that SPI could predict adrenocorticotropin values with high sensitivity and specificity [24] . Interestingly, the SPI group (remifentanil administration adjusted based on SPI values) and the control group (remifentanil administration adjusted based on traditional signs and symptoms, such as heart rate and blood pressure) did not show differences in SPI values between baseline and the intubation event; further, SPI decreased at maximal surgical stimulus. Although the report did not provide the concentration of remifentanil of the two groups, SPI values were similar between baseline and the intubation event, suggesting that the remifentanil could prevent a nociceptive response to intubation. In addition, the previous report indicated that intubation stimulus was the most powerful pain according to SPI measurements, because the maximal surgical stimulus exhibited a lower SPI value. In our study, SSI was similar between baseline and post-cranial pinning measurements, so we infer that the stimulus of cranial pinning is similar to an intubation event. However, changes in blood pressure during our study were not consistent with the previous report. On the contrary, blood pressure was increased 1 min after cranial pinning and immediately decreased, suggesting that this clinical assessment might be more sensitive than SSI. This discrepancy might be explained by the subjects recruited in that study (adults vs. children) and the type of noxious stimulus. Other reports have shown that SPI is influenced by several factors, such as posture and anaesthetic technique, and that changes in SPI and heart rate were not correlated each other [25] . Therefore, SPI and clinical findings, such as heart rate, are not always matched; this is consistent with our study.",

As we did not check the sufentanil concentration, we estimated each patient's sufentanil concentration using Guay's paediatric sufentanil model [26] ; sufentanil concentrations required nearly 45 min to reach steady-state between plasma and effect-site concentrations."

Although the duration of sufentanil administration was sufficient to achieve steady-state and we estimated sufentanil concentration for each patient, we did not check the blood concentration of sufentanil. Therefore, the three groups could not be distinguished according to the real concentration of sufentanil, but could be differentiated on the basis of the initial dose of sufentanil given to patients. The other limitation is the different force of cranial pinning, according to the attending surgeon. Although the force was not identical in all patients, SSI or other clinical response did not differ across the three groups, and thus, the pinning force did not affect the results. Another limitation is the administration of atropine; although it might cause significant HR variability or changes in SSI, we administered atropine to all patients to reduce bias in the data. Lastly, we did not check the other markers of stress response, such as plasma catecholamine levels, to confirm stress in our patient population.",
