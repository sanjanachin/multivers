The current randomized, double-blind, controlled study aimed to evaluate whether Sinuclean Nebules treatment, administered by nasal douche (Rinowash), could induce ear healing better than isotonic saline in children with OME. Methods: The study was randomized, double-blind, and controlled. Group A (30 children) was treated with Sinuclean Nebules 45 and Group B (31 children) was treated with isotonic saline; both compounds were administered by nasal nebulization with Rinowash nasal douche twice/day in the morning and in the evening for 10 days, followed by a one-week suspension, and after by a second course as the first. Tympanogram and audiometry were performed at baseline and after treatment. Results: Considering the global evaluation of the treatment: in Group A, 28 (93.3%) patients had complete resolution and 2 (6.7%) had partial resolution; in Group B, all patients had failure of treatment. There was a significant difference between groups (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The current randomized-controlled study demonstrated that Sinuclean Nebules was effective and in the treatment of children with OME.",

Antibiotics, corticosteroids (both systemic and intranasal), mucolytics, antihistamines, and decongestants are commonly prescribed, but current American guidelines do not recommend these medications for treating OME [1] . Thus, there may be interest to investigate alternative medicine. In this regard, Sinuclean is on the market in Italy as CE marked Class I medical device. Sinuclean is a water solution containing the extract of the plant Ecballium elaterium. Its extract contains various types of cucurbitacins, including B, D, I, and E. Cucurbitacins are tetracyclic triterpenes glycosides which have pharmacological activity. In fact, it has been reported that cucurbitacins may exert immune-modulatory effects [10e13]. In particular, it has been reported an inhibitory activity on cyclo-oxygenase-2 enzymes mediated through blocking of NF-kB activation. In addition, cucurbitacins have an important secretagogue activity able to drain effusive fluids (data on file). The Sinuclean Nebules is a new derivate that is indicated for the facilitation of discharging the mucus from airways and for reducing the mucosal oedema because of its osmotic and anti-inflammatory activity. It may be used by the nasal douche Rhinowash that allows a better distribution of the compound into upper airways, so it could permit the evacuation of accumulated mucus. In fact, mucus stagnation in upper airways, mainly concerning Eustachio's tube, blocks the air circulation promoting a vicious circle causing OME. So, we tested the hypothesis that increased mucus discharge may accelerate the resolution of congested airways, so accelerating mucosal healing and definitively OME resolution.
