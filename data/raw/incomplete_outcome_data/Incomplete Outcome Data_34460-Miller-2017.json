        "text": "Background: Many organizations seek to alleviate poverty in the developing world, often focusing their interventions on women. The role, status, and education of women are fundamentally important facets of development. Thus, understanding the interaction of women's educational level and the response to interventions is important. Therefore, we examined the impact of educational level of household adults on responses to a livestock-based community intervention. Methods: Six pair-matched communities in 3 districts of Nepal (Chitwan/Nawalparasi/Nuwakot), were randomly assigned to receive community development activities via women's self-help groups at baseline or 1 year later. At 6 intervals over 48 months, a 125-item questionnaire addressing family demographics and child health/nutrition was completed in each household, plus child growth monitoring. Results were analyzed in relation to the highest education attained by any woman in the household, the child's mother, men, or any other adult in the household. Results: Outcomes (wealth, water/toilet availability, child diet diversity and growth) all significantly related to adult education. However, notable differences were found comparing the impact of men's and women's education. Percent change in wealth score was significant only in households where women had primary or secondary education (respectively, p = .0009 and p < .0001). Increased soap use related only to women's education (p < .0001). When adjusted for group assignment, baseline income, wealth, and animal scores, higher women's education was significantly associated with increased household wealth (p < .0001), better child height-forage z scores (HAZ, p = .005), and improved child diet diversity (p = .01). Higher mother's education predicted better child HAZ (primary, p = .01, secondary, p = .03) and diet diversity (primary, p = .05, secondary, p < .0001). Higher men's education was significantly associated with household wealth (p = .02) and child diet diversity (p = .04), but not HAZ; higher education of any household member was associated only with household wealth (p < .0001). Moreover, households where the mother's education was better than the best-educated man also were significantly more likely to have children with better HAZ and dietary diversity (p = .03, p < .0001). Thus, the educational level of women and mothers had the broadest impact on child outcome variables. Conclusions: Household characteristics vary among participants in most community development projects. Of these, adult education likely mediates response to the inputs provided by the intervention. Particularly in interventions directed towards women, better education may enhance the ability of households to put interventions into practice, thus improving wealth, hygiene, and child diet and growth indices.",

We assumed that higher educated women might have an influential voice in making some of the necessary household decisions. However, we did not test this directly, nor did we measure women's empowerment or the degree to which they participated in the intervention activities. We also were unable to directly measure participation in household decision making according to local community rules (for example, the differences between grandmothers and young mothers in making decisions related to the child). Regardless, the level of education of the child's mother as well as of other women in the household predicted the child's HAZ and dietary diversity (both p < .05). While household decision-making is complex in these conjoint families [38, 50, 51] , it is clear that women's education is strongly linked to these important child outcomes.",

        "text": "We found convincing evidence that women's educational level related to changes over time in household wealth score, hygiene practices, child linear growth, and child diet diversity, even after adjusting for group assignment, baseline wealth score, income, and baseline animal score. The community-level intervention focused on livestock management. It is plausible that the better educated women may have been better able to put these interventions into practice, thus improving their household wealth. Wealth accumulation at the household level may have allowed more educated women to influence childcare practices, resulting in improved hygiene, child growth, and diet. The intervention did not specifically address these areas, but rather focused on wealth generation and community development. However, women's influence over these health/nutrition related variables may suggest that as households improved their access to resources through the livestock project, more educated women were better able to influence their households to invest in changed behaviors. Specific assessment of household decision-making practices might provide further insight into this pathway. Alternately, women's education may represent a proxy for some other household factor that allowed families to benefit from the intervention. Regardless, the educational level of mothers and women in the household was strongly linked to important child outcomes, specifically HAZ and diet diversity. While men's educational was also important to child and household outcomes, the key role of women's education was particularly notable. The relationships between educational achievements of individual household members and gender roles are complex, particularly within the context of specific family and cultural practices. The contributions of these factors to children's feeding patterns and nutritional status merit examination in future studies. In addition, further investigation of the relationship between women's educational level and response to agricultural and other interventions may enhance understanding of ways to assist households with lower educational attainments and the mechanisms by which these interventions are adopted by households.",
