        "text": "IMPORTANCE Acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in children commonly presents with otorrhea and negatively affects their daily activities. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution relative to ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, otic solution alone and fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone in the treatment of AOMT in children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two twin multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials with identical designs were conducted from June 24, 2011, through June 23, 2014, at ear, nose, and throat pediatric practices, general practices, hospitals, and clinical research centers. The study population comprised 662 children (331 in each trial) with AOMT in at least 1 ear who presented with moderate or severe purulent otorrhea for 3 weeks or less. Data analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin alone, or fluocinolone alone twice daily for 7 days and were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3 to 5 (undergoing therapy), 8 to 10 (end of therapy), and 18 to 22 (test of cure). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy measure was time to cessation of otorrhea. The principal secondary end point was sustained microbiological cure, defined as eradication or presumed eradication at end-of-therapy and test-of-cure visits. RESULTS A total of 662 children participating in the 2 studies were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (n = 223), ciprofloxacin alone (n = 221), or fluocinolone alone (n = 218). The median age was 2.5 years (range, 0.6-12.7 years). The median time to cessation of otorrhea was 4.23 days (95% CI, 3.65-4.95 days) in patients receiving ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with 6.95 days (95% CI, 5.66-8.20 days) in those receiving ciprofloxacin and not estimable findings in those receiving fluocinolone alone (P < .001). The clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure visit was 80.6% in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group, 67.4% in the ciprofloxacin group (difference, 13.2%; 95% CI, 5.0%-21.4%; P = .002), and 47.6% in the fluocinolone group (difference, 33.0%; 95% CI, 24.0%-42.0%; P < .001). The sustained microbiological cure rate was 79.7% in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group vs 67.7% in the ciprofloxacin group (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, 0.8%-23.0%; P = .04) and 37.6% in the fluocinolone group (difference, 42.1%; 95% CI, 29.3%-54.8%; P < .001). Only 7 (3.1%) of the patients receiving ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, 8 (3.6%) of the patients receiving ciprofloxacin, and 10 (4.7%) of the patients receiving fluocinolone presented with adverse events related to study medication. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The combination of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone is more effective than treatment with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for AOMT, and it is safe and well tolerated in children.",

        "text": "A cute otitis media (AOM) is an inflammation of the middle ear that usually results from an upper respiratory tract infection. When fluid accompanies the inflammation, the condition is known as otitis media with effusion. The most common surgery performed on children for the treatment of recurrent AOM and otitis media with effusion is the insertion of tympanostomy tubes (TTs) into the eardrum, which produces a decrease in the frequency of ear infections, allows drainage of effusion, and permits topical administration of antibiotics to the middle ear [1] [2] [3] [4] when infection occurs. In the United States, almost 700 000 children receive TTs every year. 5 Placement of TTs significantly improves hearing, reduces effusion, and is associated with improvement in quality of life for children with recurrent AOM, otitis media with effusion, or both. [6] [7] [8] Otorrhea is the most frequent complication after the insertion of the TTs and may occur immediately after surgery or during the time the TTs remain in place. Early postoperative otorrhea occurs in approximately 10% to 20% of children, whereas published rates of delayed tube otorrhea range from 4% to 83%. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) differs clinically and microbiologically from AOM in that AOMT frequently presents with sudden onset of purulent otorrhea. 17 Bacteria commonly isolated from children with AOMT include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis as well as pathogens associated with acute otitis externa infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 17, 18 Treatment options for AOMT include systemic and topical antibiotics with or without corticosteroids. 17 The selection of the proper agent should be based on a consideration of benefits and risks, including the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the ototoxicity related to the treatment. Clinical trials have revealed the superiority of topical treatment with fluoroquinolones, used alone or in combination with a corticosteroid, compared with oral amoxicillin and clavulanate. 1, 19 Other studies 18, 20 have found that topical ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone combination improves resolution of AOMT compared with ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin alone. These studies 18, 20 indicate that an effective and safe treatment option for AOMT is the use of a topical fluoroquinolone with the addition of a corticosteroid. Topical ciprofloxacin has been used in combination with fluocinolone acetonide for the treatment of diffuse otitis externa. This combination has proved to be a safe and effective treatment, with superior levels of clinical efficacy and bacteriologic response to those obtained with ciprofloxacin alone. 21 This article presents the results of 2 clinical studies (Clinical Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of DF289 Plus DF277 Otic Solution in the Treatment of Middle Ear Infections in Pediatric Patients [CIFLOTIII/10IA02] and Efficacy and Safety of DF289 Plus DF277 Otic Solution in the Treatment of Middle Ear Infections in Pediatric Patients [CIFLOTIII/ 10IA04]) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution relative to ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, otic solution alone and fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone in children with AOMT.",

Fluocinolone, like other topical corticosteroids, has antiinflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The principal aim of these studies was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with ciprofloxacin alone and fluocinolone alone in patients with AOMT. The primary efficacy variable evaluated was TCO. The results indicate that topical treatment with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was statistically superior to ciprofloxacin alone and fluocinolone alone in children aged 6 months to 12 years with AOMT. Resolution of otorrhea occurred at 4.23 days in patients receiving ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with 6.95 days in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone, revealing the superiority of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone in the treatment response (P < .001). This difference (2.7 days) in favor of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone is clinically meaningful because it represents a 64% improvement in clinical response and an important advantage over ciprofloxacin as a single-agent antibiotic therapy. Although the median TCO for the fluocinolone group was not estimable, the comparison vs the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone combination revealed a significant difference in favor of the combination. A significant reduction of otorrhea with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was recorded at visit 2.",
