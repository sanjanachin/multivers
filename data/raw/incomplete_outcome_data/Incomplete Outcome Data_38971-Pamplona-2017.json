Compensatory articulation requires a prolonged period of speech intervention that should include reinforcement at home. However, frequently relatives do not know how to work with their children at home. Objective: To study whether the use of audiovisual materials especially designed for complementing speech pathology treatment in children with compensatory articulation can be effective for stimulating articulation practice at home and consequently enhancing speech normalization in children with cleft palate. Materials and methods: Eighty-two patients with compensatory articulation were studied. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Both groups received speech pathology treatment aimed to correct articulation placement. In addition, patients from the active group received a set of audiovisual materials to be used at home. Parents were instructed about strategies and ideas about how to use the materials with their children. Severity of compensatory articulation was compared at the onset and at the end of the speech intervention. Results: After the speech therapy period, the group of patients using audiovisual materials at home demonstrated significantly greater improvement in articulation, as compared with the patients receiving speech pathology treatment on e site without audiovisual supporting materials. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that audiovisual materials especially designed for practicing adequate articulation placement at home can be effective for reinforcing and enhancing speech pathology treatment of patients with cleft palate and compensatory articulation.",

Some speech sound disorders in these cases are related to velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and are known as compensatory articulation errors (CA). Some reports describe that these errors begin due to the structural abnormalities and become incorporated into the system of linguistic and phonological rules that are still in development. These articulatory deficits can be considered at the level of phonological representations involving cognitive components for managing the sounds of Speech [2, 3] and are related to other areas of language and higher levels of organization such as the abstract or decontextualized thought [4, 5] . In contrast, some clinicians view these errors as phonetic involving inaccurate learning and anatomic and physiologic motor deficits [2, 6, 7] . Therefore, in general the speech pathology (SP) intervention approach for CA can be a phonologic or linguistic approach or a phonetic or motor e based approach. There is still controversy in the related scientific literature about which approach is more effective. A recent systematic review found little evidence to support any specific intervention [8] .

All patients were assessed at the onset and at the end of the Speech Summer Camp, including an analysis based on the WLM and basic phonological principles. Special attention was focused on the detection of compensatory articulation patterns, the placement and manner of articulation of these patterns and the phonological rules of the phonological system of each child. For this purpose, children were videotaped interacting with a trained speech and language pathologist (SLP) during storytelling for 30 min. A 20 min segment was selected where a high level of verbal interaction occurred. The 20 min of interaction were transcribed verbatim for analyzing the presence and severity of compensatory articulation. All the SLP's participating in this study had been performing phonological transcriptions of cleft palate children for at least 5 years. A blind procedure was utilized for assessing the reliability of the evaluation of CA severity. All analyses were independently conducted by twotrained SLP.

Changing the rules that the child has already established for the production of speech sounds is not an easy task. It has been suggested that SP treatment for correcting CA requires intensive stimulation [14] . However, it is often difficult for the patients and their families to find accessible speech services or transportation to nearby centers. These difficulties are more frequent and severe in developing countries. Furthermore, it is also difficult to find effective methods for stimulating correct articulation at home and asking the child to repeat himself or articulate with adequate placement and manner often affects the family dynamics. The purpose of this paper was to study whether the use of audiovisual materials especially designed for stimulating and enhancing articulation work at home in CCP could enhance CA correction. It was hypothesized that CCP with speech disorders could benefit and improve articulation with the use of these materials. The results of this study supported this hypothesis. Audiovisual materials can provide an adequate and attractive framework for CCP with CA. Listening, singing, reading aloud, and coloring, are usually attractive activities for children in the age range studied for this project. We believe that all linguistic interactions should take place within significant contexts. Other authors have also stated the importance of meaningful contexts for working speech and language [12, 15, 36] . It has been described that storybook reading is an ideal context for stimulating speech and language [12] . The structure and relationships present in the story, the ideas and actions of the characters, the message of the story can contribute to develop some knowledge and strategies for making meaning of everyday events. The songs and stories in the audiovisual materials contain simple stories that in addition to providing information about the narrative structure can help to establish a meaningful context for stimulating articulation at home since they provide the needed structure for articulating while having fun with music and rhythm. Recently, studies about the influence of music in different cognitive domains have started to appear and scientists have begun to learn about the power of music [18, 25, 37] .",

Some of these strategies are used in the audiovisual material for developing phonologic awareness and stimulating the development of phonology in CCP and CA. Having this information in an accessible and redundant form by hearing and singing can be a motivating way for modifying articulation patterns. The songs of the audiovisual materials provide a structured and motivating context for stimulating speech at home. All songs are composed of a simple story to practice language and narratives. Also, the information in the illustrations and the language used in context can be great for working articulation and the management of the sounds of speech. The audiovisual material simultaneously provides the children with audio, visual and phonologic information in order to enhance correction of faulty articulation placement patterns and carry over into connected e conversational speech. For families of CCP, it is not easy to find effective ways for practicing articulation at home. However, SP treatment should attempt to extend to treatment sessions beyond the clinic. The speech and language pathologist has a responsibility to guide parents on how to work on improving articulation at home. Providing engaging materials with specific guidelines for their appropriate use can enhance the final speech outcome of CCP. The children included in this study had severe CA since many of them came from far places and did not have therapy before the Summer Camp. It is noteworthy that despite all showed progress in articulation, none of the patients attending the camp could correct articulation completely. This may be due to the short duration of the camp. We also have to consider that at the onset of the camp the groups were not completely equivalent in the severity of articulation since the active group showed lower levels in the scale of severity of articulation implying a more severe problem in articulation. However, even when starting with more severe articulation disorder, children in the active group had significantly higher levels than the control group at the end of the camp, showing a greater improvement for the group with the use of the audiovisual materials. In conclusion, from the results of this study it seems that the use of supporting audiovisual materials for continuing stimulation at home enhances the correction of CA in patients with cleft palate. After SP treatment an evaluation of VPI should be realized. For this purpose, imaging procedures such as videonasopharyngoscopy and/or videofluoroscopy will be necessary in order to evaluate velopharyngeal closure during speech [28] since correcting articulation is not sufficient for correcting VPI. The limitations of this clinical trial should not be overlooked, including the relatively reduced number of patients in both groups, the short follow up period and the fact that the patients were receiving speech pathology treatment in a particular clinical setting, namely a speech summer camp. Although the use of audiovisual materials seems to be a promising tool, it will be necessary to study larger number of patients with different levels of severity of CA for longer periods of time and in various clinical settings of speech pathology treatment. It will also be interesting to study if audiovisual materials could be effective for treating articulation disorders at home, especially in cases in which attending a formal speech pathology intervention in a clinical or school setting is not feasible.",
