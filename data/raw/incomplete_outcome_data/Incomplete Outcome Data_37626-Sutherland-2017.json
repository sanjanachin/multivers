        "text": "Introduction: Although comprehensive school-based physical activity interventions are efficacious when tested under research conditions, they often require adaptation in order for implementation at scale. This paper reports the effectiveness of an adapted efficacious school-based intervention in improving children's moderate to vigorous physical activity. The impact of strategies to support program implementation was also assessed. Design: A cluster RCT of low socioeconomic elementary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Setting/participants: Consenting schools were randomized (25 intervention, 21 control) using a computerized random number function. Follow-up measures were taken at 6 months postrandomization (May-August 2015) by blinded research assistants. The multicomponent schoolbased intervention, based on an efficacious school-based physical activity program (Supporting Children's Outcomes using Rewards, Exercise and Skills), consisted of four physical activity strategies and seven implementation support strategies. The intervention was adapted for scalability and delivery by a local health service over 6 months. The primary outcome was accelerometer assessed, student mean daily minutes spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity. Physical education lesson quality and other school physical activity practices were also assessed. Results: Participants (n\u00bc1,139, 49% male) were third-through sixth-grade students at follow-up (May-August 2015). Valid wear time and analysis of data were provided for 989 (86%) participants (571 intervention, 568 control). At 6-month follow-up, there were no significant effects in overall daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity between groups (1.96 minutes, 95% CI\u00bc-3.49, 7.41, p\u00bc0.48). However, adjusted difference in mean minutes of overall vigorous physical activity (2.19, 95% CI\u00bc0.06, 4.32, p\u00bc0.04); mean minutes of school day moderate to vigorous physical activity (2.90, 95% CI\u00bc0.06, 5.85, p\u00bc0.05); and mean minutes of school day vigorous physical activity (1.81, 95% CI\u00bc0.78, 2.83, p\u22640.01) were significantly different in favor of the intervention group. Physical education lesson quality and school physical activity practices were significantly different favoring the intervention group (analyzed October 2015-January 2016). Conclusions: The modified intervention was not effective in increasing children's overall daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity, when adapted for implementation at scale. However, the intervention did improve daily minutes of vigorous physical activity and school day moderate to vigorous physical activity, lesson quality, and school physical activity practices.",

Consequently, interventions to improve children's levels of MVPA are a public health priority. 4 Schools are key settings for interventions, providing universal access to children on a continuous and intensive basis. 3, 5, 6 Systematic reviews indicate school-based interventions are effective and sustainable in improving child PA. 3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Despite the existence of effective schoolbased PA interventions, unless programs are implemented at scale, they cannot benefit child health. 12, 13 Even with substantial government investment, schools often fail to adopt effective PA practices. 14, 15 For example, audits of teacher schedules and in-school observations indicate just 5%-20% of schools in the U.S. complied with mandated school Physical Education (PE) policies. 16 Similar implementation difficulties have been reported in child care settings following efforts to implement evidence-based policies promoting PA. [17] [18] [19] [20] The limited translation of PA interventions may result as the interventions trialed may not be immediately amenable to large-scale implementation. Published PA interventions are often complex, trialed under ideal conditions, and administered by experts. 21, 22 Delivery of such interventions is, therefore, often incompatible with usual school routines, expertise, or resources. Findings of such studies have limited external validity and translation is a considerable challenge. 17 Although scaling up effective health interventions is an emerging health priority, 23, 24 delivering programs at scale may require adaptation of program components and implementation support strategies to cater for greater numbers, diversity, and differences in geographic and socioeconomic contexts. 25 Given the need for government action to enhance PA, policy makers and school administrators often adapt interventions to make them amenable to implementation within local contexts. 26 In doing so, intervention effectiveness may be compromised. Indeed, meta-analyses of obesity prevention and PA interventions in other settings suggests that the effects of interventions implemented in more real-world contexts are less than half that reported in interventions trialed under tightly controlled research conditions. 27, 28 Despite a large number of trials reporting the effects of school-based PA interventions, 3 few have assessed the impact of adapting an efficacious intervention for largescale implementation within a real-world context. A recent national dissemination of a promising schoolbased obesity prevention intervention was conducted in the Netherlands. 29 To prepare for dissemination, adaptations to the program were made based on teacher feedback and process evaluation from the efficacy trial. 30 Similarly, an efficacious elementary school-based PA intervention was modified to enhance reach via the use of web-based intervention components. 31 Although adaptations are undertaken routinely as part of government supported rollout of health initiatives, the impact of modifications are rarely evaluated and, therefore, unknown.",
