There is no consensus on the dose of corticosteroid administered to the mother expected to have a preterm baby. This study is conducted to compare the effectiveness of two popular regimens of dexamethasone administration in decreasing incidence of RDS, necrotizing enterocolitis, IVH and neonatal mortality rate. Methods: Randomized control trial was conducted at Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad from 1 st to 31 st August, 2014. Sample size was set at 50. Block randomization was employed in the trial to allocate the patients into corresponding groups 'A' and 'B'. Group A was administered 6mg dexamethasone in 4 doses 12 hours apart and group B was administered 2 doses 12 hours apart. Results: Forty-eight patients participated in the study with 24 patients in each group. Mean age and period gestation of participants were 28.4 years\u00b14.3 SD and 34 weeks\u00b11.9 SD respectively. Four patients in group A gave birth to neonate with RDS compared to two cases in group B. Group B had higher incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and neonatal mortalities. However, none of these differences observed were statistically significant. No case of IVH was reported in either of the groups. Conclusion: Both the popular regimens of dexamethasone administration are equally effective in decreasing the incidence of neonatal diseases.",

While comparing the results with a different corticosteroid, Brownfoot FC et al 16 showed statistically insignificant difference in reducing the incidence of RDS when comparing dexamethasone with betamethasone. Roberts D et al 4 reported that although corticosteroids have a role in the reducing the incidence of RDS, supremacy of any one regimen over another cannot be stated with certainty. Similarly, a significant lower incidence of RDS was reported in infants born to mother who were given 4 doses of dexamethasone by Crowther et al. 17 Our results showed no case of Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) in either of the groups. This can be attributed to the findings of Brownfoot FC et al 16 reporting a decrease in incidence of intra-ventricular haemorrhage (IVH) by administration of corticosteroids. This Cochrane review while comparing dexamethasone with betamethasone revealed that 6mg dexamethasone in four doses decreased IVH incidence when compared with betamethasone. However, this lack of difference in the incidence of IVH among the two regimens can also be attributed to small sample size in our pilot study.",
