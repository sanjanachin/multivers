We conducted a series of studies to test the acceptability of complementary foods fortified with either powdered beef liver, beef meat, beef liver + meat or placebo among 96 Indonesian children aged 12 to 23 mo. This was achieved by determining liking of a single test food with added study powder, followed by a 2-wk home trial and focus group discussions to assess liking during repeated consumption of the study powders added to daily meals. The test food with added beef powders were well liked by mothers, with liking scores never falling below neutral on a 7-point scale. After home use, mothers reported that their children moderately liked their meals with added powder, with scores ranging between 3.3 and 3.5 on a 5-point scale. With the exception of lower liking for the combination beef liver + meat powder, there were no detectable differences in mothers' overall perception of child's liking between the placebo and any of the study powders. The low disappearance rate of the study powders during the home trial was a concern, with mothers reporting a strong smell and fishy odor as the major reason why children did not like their meals. Nonetheless, mothers declared they would continue using the powder on account of the nutritional value and perceived health benefits. Strategies are underway to minimize the level of fishy odor in the beef liver powder.",

        "text": "together with continued breastfeeding to at least 24 mo of age, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidelines for infant and young child feeding (IYCF) (World Health Organization/UNICEF 2003; World Health Organization 2010). However, in Indonesia compliance to these IYCF guidelines has been poor. In a recent national survey, only 35% of breastfed children aged 6 to 23 mo were fed according to the WHO IYCF guidelines (Ng and others 2012) . Hence, it is not surprising that major deficits in the micronutrient adequacy of complementary diets for Indonesian children 6 to 23 mo of age have been reported. Specifically, consistently large discrepancies between the content of iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin B-12, and sometimes vitamin Ain complementary foods of breastfed children and the amounts required have been identified (Ferguson and others 2006; Santika and others 2009) . These deficits arise in part because their ricebased complementary foods have a low dry matter content and are rarely enriched with animal-source foods, dark green leafy vegetables or yellow-orange fruits. As a consequence, a high prevalence of anemia and coexisting micronutrient deficiencies has been reported during early childhood in Indonesia (Dijkhuizen and others 2001; Lind and others 2004 In an effort to meet the micronutrient needs of infants and young children in Indonesia, locally available and affordable foods as sources of essential nutrients in complementary feeding are being promoted. In Indonesia chicken liver has been recommended as a component of complementary diets to enhance their micronutrient adequacy and dietary diversity (Ferguson and others 2006; Santika and others 2009) , a practice endorsed earlier by WHO (World Health Organization 1998). Other investigators have encouraged the inclusion of beef, which like liver, can supply a rich source of bioavailable heme iron, zinc, and vitamin B-12 in complementary diets (Pachon and others 2007; Hambidge and others 2011; Krebs and others 2012) . Nevertheless, even with the addition of pureed liver or beef to complementary diets, requirements for iron and zinc are not consistently met (Santika and others 2009) . These micronutrient deficits could be overcome, however, by freeze drying the liver or beef to yield desiccated powders with a more concentrated source of micronutrients (Gailani and Fung 1986) . Desiccated beef and beef liver have the added advantage of a longer shelf life, and a vitamin A concentration that is no longer of concern (Wilkinson and others 1981; Chavasit and others 2002; Institute of Medicine 2006) . Before recommending powdered beef or beef liver to fortify complementary diets in Indonesia, it is necessary to establish their acceptability for young children and their mothers. Therefore, our objective was to test the acceptability by young breastfed children and their mothers of a range of complementary foods fortified with either powdered beef or beef liver at the time of consumption. This was achieved in 3 phases, first by determining liking of a single test food with added study powder in an acceptability trial held once in a central location, followed by a 2-wk trial in the home to assess liking during repeated consumption of the study powders added to daily meals. Finally, focus group discussions (FGDs) with mothers of children who participated in the previous 2 phases were conducted.",

Mothers were permitted to breastfeed their infants but instructed to avoid breastfeeding for at least 1 h prior to the testing session. At the beginning of each session, mothers and their children were presented with a test food-Perkedel (fried potato patty consisting of potato, tapioca flour, egg white, and garlic)-containing half of the recommended daily dose of randomly assigned powder. The total weight of the test food serving was approximately 110 g. The energy content per serving of each test food was as follows: beef liver, 336 kcal; beef liver and meat, 318 kcal; beef meat, 337 kcal; placebo, 299 kcal. Before tasting, mothers were asked to indicate their acceptability of the color and smell of the test food with the added powder using a 7-point cued facial response scale (ranging from \"dislike a lot\" through to \"like a lot\") adapted from Pelletier and Lawless (Pelletier and Lawless 2003) . For each attribute, the mothers were shown 3 faces-a smiley face labeled \"like,\" a neutral face labeled \"neutral\" and a frowning face labeled \"dislike\"-and asked to indicate which face best represented their liking. If a mother chose the smiley face, she was shown 3 additional faces with different degrees of smiling labeled as \"like a little,\" \"like,\" and \"like a lot.\" The mother was asked to indicate which of these smiley faces represented her liking. Conversely, if the mother chose the frowning face, she was shown 3 additional faces of varying degrees of unhappiness. From these faces, the mother was asked to select the frown which best represented her degree of disliking ranging from \"dislike a lot,\" \"dislike,\" and \"dislike a little.\" Next, mothers were asked to consume the test food and indicate their acceptability of taste and texture using the same 7-point cued facial response scale. A weighed sample of study test food was then fed to the child by the mother until refusal, defined as 3 negative behaviors (for example, child closes mouth, turns face away, spits out food, cries, runs away from the mother), as recorded by a trained observer.

Each of the 2 doses was based on the assumption that, provided the complementary foods consumed by young Indonesian children were fortified daily with the contents of the entire sachet, they were likely to overcome the micronutrient deficits and thus meet their theoretical micronutrient requirements, while not exceeding the tolerable upper levels, particularly for vitamin A (Inst. of Medicine 2006; Kraemer and others 2008) . Mothers were instructed to mix half of the sachet with a complementary food prepared in the morning and the remainder with food at mid-day.

This trend is not unexpected, as repeated exposure by young children to foods is known to increase both their acceptance and intake of foods (Sullivan and Birch 1994). Nevertheless, even in the second week, only about two-thirds of each daily sachet of beef powder fortificant supplied was offered to the children over 2 meals, irrespective of the nature of the fortificant (Table 4) . Furthermore, there is a concern that the study powder disappearance rate method used may overstate adherence as shown in a nutritional supplementation trial of 9-to 18-mo-old children in Burkina Faso. In this trial, direct home observation indicated a substantially lower proportion of supplement consumption as compared to the more feasible and less costly disappearance rate method (Abbeddou and others 2015) .",
