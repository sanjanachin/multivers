In total, 144 children with spastic CP who had dynamic equinus foot deformity were assigned randomly to the Botulax group (injection of letibotulinum toxin A) or the Botox group (injection of onabotulinum toxin A). The Physician's Rating Scale (PRS), ankle plantar flexor spasticity using the Modified Tardieu Scale, the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)-88, and the GMFM-66 were completed before injection and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks after injection. The PRS responder rate was 60.27% in the Botulax group and 61.43% in the Botox group at 12 weeks after treatment, and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in responder rates was \u221217.16%, higher than the non-inferiority margin of \u221224.00%. The clinical efficacy and the safety profiles of the groups did not significantly differ.
