[57] , who implemented the Mighty Moves\u00ae intervention (consisting of 15-20 min classroom lessons focused on gross motor skill acquisition for 18 weeks) found no significant effect of their intervention on preschoolers' physical activity. Similarly, Jones and colleagues [58] implemented the Jump Start Frequencies (n) unless otherwise noted. Groups were compared using independent t-tests for continuous data and x 2 tests were used for categorical LPA light physical activity, MVPA moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, TPA total physical activity, Exp. experimental condition Reported differences for each time period represent the difference between groups (experimental minus control), when compared with baseline a b c Fig. 3 a, b , c Preschoolers' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (a), total physical activity (b), and sedentary time (c) in minutes per hour across four measurement times for experimental and control groups program which also focused on preschoolers' gross motor skills and comprised professional development for childcare staff in addition to structured and unstructured activities for children. While the results of their intervention were not significant, improvements in activity behaviours were reported for children enrolled in the intervention. In a large Belgian population, De Creamer and colleagues found the ToyBox intervention, which transpired in Kindergarten classrooms, but included parents and families in the intervention, had a significant effect on preschoolers' activity, but noted this effect was strongest for boys and for preschoolers from higher socioeconomic classes [59] . Finally, Goldfield et al. [34] adopted a train-the-trainer approach and coupled it with a resource manual which provided childcare staff with guidance on facilitating structured and unstructured physical activities. Preschoolers in the intervention group displayed greater increases in minutes of TPA and LPA, but not MVPA at 6-months [34] . Despite the inconsistent findings reported in these 4 studies, childcare centres still maintain promise as an appropriate venue for intervening given the substantial portion of their day that young children spend in these venues [19] . Moreover, young children have been noted to accumulate more MVPA in care, compared to at home [60] , which supports the feasibility of higher intensity physical activity in the childcare environment. The SPACE intervention involved two common intervention components -environmental modifications; specifically, the addition of portable play equipment [61] as well as the provision of staff training [34] . The modification to the required outdoor playtime schedules at centre-based childcare facilities has been a less common approach to childcare interventions. To our knowledge, only a few interventions have adopted a similar approach and the results remain ambiguous. Wolfenden and colleague's [38] intervention divided the typical single 45-min bout of outdoor playtime afforded in Australian childcare centres into three shorter outdoor sessions of 15 min each; however, no results have been published to date. Similar to the SPACE intervention, Alhassan and colleagues [62] also implemented four 30-min outdoor play sessions in a small number of childcare centres in the United States. While these researchers found no significant effect of their intervention on Latino preschoolers' MVPA, it is possible this was a consequence of the short implementation timeframe of only two days.",

        "text": "Researchers have previously identified outdoor playtime as a strong correlate of young children's physical activity [63, 64] . In fact, Vanderloo and colleagues [27] noted that preschoolers were two times more active outdoors than indoors, averaging 31.68 min/h compared to 14.42 min/h outdoors versus indoors, respectively. With consideration of higher intensity activity, these same researchers reported that preschoolers' MVPA levels were 10 times higher outdoors compared to indoors. Moreover, as noted previously, researchers have found that preschoolers display the most physical activity during the first 10 min outdoors [29, 65] and that activity is most intense during this time [30] . To capitalize on this peak in activity participation for this cohort, a modified outdoor playtime schedule was afforded to preschoolers in the SPACE intervention; specifically, four shorter outdoor sessions, compared to the typical two sessions (preschoolers' total outdoor time did not change -2 h per day). Given the intermittent nature of young children's activity behaviours [66] , offering more frequent, but shorter outdoor playtime sessions, appears to be a viable approach for promoting improved activity behaviours. Despite noted challenges with implementing increased outdoor playtime sessions within their current curriculum, our process evaluation, which captured attendance, adherence, dose delivered, content and feasibility, noted an adherence rate (over 70%) to these outdoor sessions in the SPACE intervention was high (Driediger MV, Vanderloo LM, Burke SM, Irwin JD, Gaston A, Timmons BW, et al. The feasibility and appropriateness of the supporting physical activity in the childcare environment (SPACE) intervention: a process evaluation. Health Educ Behav. Submitted). This suggests that the modified playtime schedule was feasible for childcare staff to follow. In addition to significantly increasing physical activity levels, the SPACE intervention was also effective at decreasing preschoolers' sedentary time. This finding is similar to Goldfield et al. [34] who also displayed significant decreases in sedentary time as a consequence of their childcare-based intervention. De Craemer and colleagues [33] , who implemented the ToyBox-study, a kindergarten-based, family involved, intervention in over 800 Belgian preschoolers, found no significant decreases in sedentary time among their sample. However, a decrease in objectively and subjectively measured sedentary time was observed among preschoolers from the intervention group who were enrolled in high socioeconomic status kindergartens. A great deal of attention has recently been placed on sedentary behaviours and their associated negative health consequences; therefore, the effectiveness of the SPACE intervention to decrease this behaviour is noteworthy [10] . The replacement of sedentary time with MVPA, as observed in the present study, is a promising first step.",
