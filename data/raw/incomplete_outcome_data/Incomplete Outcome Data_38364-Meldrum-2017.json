The specific findings according to the FADS gene cluster show biological plausibility, with FADS1 encoding for the delta5-desaturase enzyme which is responsible for the conversion of 20:4n-3 to EPA (20:5n-3). Furthermore, the significant improvement in DHA for only minor homozygous carriers is supported by the numerous previous association studies which have identified minor allele carriers as having lower desaturation of LCPUFA, and were likely to receive the greatest benefit from supplementation. However, previous studies have found associations for EPA, AA and 22:5 (n-3) (Docosapentaenoic Acid) and not DHA, which was thought to be strongly related to dietary intake, rather than endogenous synthesis. Due to role of FADS2 in the elongation of 22:5n-3 to ultimately obtain DHA, it is surprising that this gene cluster was not identified as significant in the present analysis or that AA and EPA were not found to be associated with FADS1 haplotypes or SNPs. o increased endogenous synthesis of DHA is seen in the placebo group for minor allele carriers. The exploratory nature of the study and the reduced sample size may account for this. In addition, the high variability in fatty acid results (particularly EPA had large standard deviations), likely due to differences in supplement compliance, may have made it difficult to detect differences between genotypes.

        "text": "Our study is not without its limitations. The sample size was particularly small, and we cannot rule out the possibility that we have a reduced ability to detect any other true effects. Therefore, our study requires replication by larger RCTs to confirm the findings. Due to the small sample size and the exploratory nature of the study, we chose not to adjust for multiple comparisons, but rather to limit the number of comparisons using a systematic method of analysis. Yet, the consistent nature of the significant results, both in haplotype, SNP, and interaction effect, appears to make Type I errors that seem unlikely. Another potential limitation was the effect of maternal genotype and its influence on breast milk PUFA. Several authors have found that maternal FADS genotype is associated with the LCPUFA content of breast milk, which can affect infant status and later phenotype [33, 34, 49] . As the vast majority of infants were breastfed during the course of the trial (>90%), this may have relevance for our study, as a fully breast fed infant in Australia consumes approximately 107.1 mg per day of DHA (assuming 0.34% of fatty acids, 750 ml per day intake with 4.2 g of fat per 100 ml), and while this is lower than the supplement dose of 280 mg per day, it may still contribute significantly to the DHA status of the infants. We do not have access to maternal genotype, which limits our investigation of this concern. Therefore, it remains a possibility that maternal FADS genotype may be a significant contributor to infant LCPUFA at 6 months, along with infant genotype.",

        "text": "The present study does have a number of strengths. This is the first RCT in the neonatal period to examine the differential effects of an n-3 LCPUFA intervention according to FADS genotype. The use of a randomised cohort limits the effect of diet on LCPUFA levels, with breast milk LCPUFA levels likely balanced between placebo and treatment groups. The use of both plasma and erythrocyte measurements was important to detect any possible effect in a number of PUFA biomarkers. We also genotyped a number of SNPs which were found to be linked to fatty acids in the previous research, thus increasing the possibility of identifying a functional SNP or haplotype. In conclusion, the results of this small exploratory study suggest that FADS genotype can alter the effects of LCPUFA supplementation. Our results suggest that minor allele homozygous carriers receive the greatest benefit from supplementation, with statistically increased DHA levels. Our findings support the suggestion by authors that genetic heterogeneity may have contributed to inconsistent findings of RCTs investigating the neonatal supply of LCPUFA on developmental outcome. Further larger RCTs are required to confirm these exploratory findings, and examine the association between FADS genotype, n-3 LCPUFA status, and neurological development to evaluate the relevance of FADS genotype on fatty-acid-related phenotypes.",
