Methods We conducted a multicenter, crossover pilot trial to determine if short, more frequent (5 days per week) in-center HD was feasible and associated with improvements in blood pressure compared with three conventional HD treatments per week. Because adult studies have not controlled for the weekly duration of dialysis, we fixed the total treatment time at 12 h a week of dialysis during two 3-month study periods; only frequency varied from 5 to 3 days per week between study periods. Results Eight children (median age 16.7 years) consented at three children's hospitals. The prespecified primary composite outcome was a sustained 10% decrease in systolic blood pressure and/or a decrease in antihypertensive medications relative to each study period's baseline. Among the six patients completing both study periods, five (83.3%) experienced the primary outcome during HD performed 5 days per week but not 3 days per week; one of the six (16.7%) achieved that outcome during 3-day but not 5-day (p = 0.22) per week HD. During 5-day HD, all patients had significantly more treatments during which their pre-HD systolic (p = 0.01) or diastolic (p = 0.01) blood pressure was 10% lower than baseline. Conclusions We observed that more frequent HD sessions per week was feasible and associated with improved blood pressure control, but barriers to changing thrice-weekly standard of care include financial reimbursement and the time demands associated with more frequent treatments.",

In most of our patients, we hired private taxi companies, some of which were already contracting with patients' insurance companies to provide ESKD transportation. To change the standard of care, future studies will need to show that alternative dialysis treatment schedules are cost-saving or, at the very least, cost neutral, to be able to pay for staffing, supplies, and transportation. The time demands on providers, families, and patients must equally be addressed.

            "Conducting this pilot trial, we learned about the practical barriers to providing more frequent or more intensive HD regimens.",
            "Specifically, we observed significant challenges for patients in obtaining transportation for the extra two weekly treatments, especially because most children are brought to dialysis without their parents.",
            "In most of our patients, we hired private taxi companies, some of which were already contracting with patients' insurance companies to provide ESKD transportation.",
            "To change the standard of care, future studies will need to show that alternative dialysis treatment schedules are cost-saving or, at the very least, cost neutral, to be able to pay for staffing, supplies, and transportation.",
            "The time demands on providers, families, and patients must equally be addressed.",
            "More time spent receiving HD may decrease patient school attendance and performance, and given the school time that children are already missing and the cognitive challenges that children with ESKD experience [33, 34] , this is an area that deserves further study."

The study was limited by its small size, relatively short follow-up period, enrollment of only adolescents, lack of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, antihypertensive medication administration that was nonstandardized, recording changes in dry weight once a month only, and crossover design that had the potential for unequal carryover effects across study periods.",
