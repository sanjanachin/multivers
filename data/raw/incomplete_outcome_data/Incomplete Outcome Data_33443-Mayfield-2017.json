METHODS: A longitudinal, cluster-randomized design was employed in 4 elementary school playgrounds where students (third to fifth) from 2 intervention and 2 control schools were observed during recess periods. The intervention included environmental changes (eg, marked surfaces) and student education. Data were collected using systematic observations of youth behavior and semistructured interviews conducted with key informants. Mixed-effects regression models controlling for scans nested within days nested within schools estimated the interaction of measurement period and treatment condition on children's PA, PSB, and ASB. It was hypothesized that children in intervention, but not control schools, would demonstrate increased PA/PSB and decreased ASB. RESULTS: Contrary to the hypotheses, intervention and control schools showed favorable changes for all dependent variables except for PSB, but 1 intervention and 1 control school drove these effects. Follow-up interviews indicated variability in implementation and lack of adherence to the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: P2 may promote increased PA during recess, but these results demonstrate the complexity of intervention implementation and the need for rigor when measuring intervention fidelity in real-world settings.",

One of the few unstructured/autonomous opportunities for PA during the school day is recess, 6 which may contribute between 6% and 13% of children's total daily MVPA recommendations. 7 Various factors have been shown to influence the amount of PA children accumulate during recess, including both individual factors such as age and sex of children, 8 and environmental factors such as the size of the playground, 9 availability of equipment and markings, 10 and whether play is structured or unstructured (eg, organized games). 11 A systematic review examining the impact of playground design on increased levels of PA during recess found that interventions based on playground markings plus physical structures significantly increase PA at both posttreatment and 4-to 6-week term follow-up. 8 Researchers have also indicated that recess environments play an important role in promotion of PSB by encouraging group play and reducing social isolation. 12 Environmental modifications to increase MVPA also reduce physical isolation as well as increase supervision, factors that are known to reduce bullying in schools. 13 Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that programs to promote MVPA that also focus on teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution may reduce the occurrence of bullying. Mechanistically, such programming might increase self-regulatory behaviors, which are associated with both PA 14 and bullying. 15 There are numerous commercially available toolkits and curricula for increasing PA in schools that are well received and widely used by schools and after-care settings.
