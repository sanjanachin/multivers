The ergogenic ability of the squat is well known. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 6-week front squat and hip thrust programs in adolescent male athletes. Vertical jump height, horizontal jump distance, 10-and 20-m sprint times, and isometric midthigh pull peak force were among the measured performance variables, in addition to front squat and hip thrust 3 repetition maximum (3RM) strength. Magnitude-based effect sizes revealed potentially beneficial effects for the front squat in both front squat 3RM strength and vertical jump height when compared with the hip thrust. No clear benefit for one intervention was observed for horizontal jump performance. Potentially beneficial effects were observed for the hip thrust compared with the front squat in 10-and 20-m sprint times. The hip thrust was likely superior for improving normalized isometric midthigh pull strength and very likely superior for improving hip thrust 3RM and isometric midthigh pull strength. These results support the force vector theory.",

        "text": "T he barbell hip thrust, introduced in the literature by Contreras et al. (13) , is a loaded bridging exercise used to target the hip extensor musculature, which includes the gluteus maximus and hamstrings. Because the hip thrust requires consistent hip extension moment production throughout its entire range of motion, it may effectively enhance horizontal force production, improve sprint running speed, and promote gluteus maximus hypertrophy (4, 13, 18, 19) . The consistent hip extension moment requisites of the hip thrust may play a crucial role in transference, as it has been theorized that hip extension moment-angle curves play a role in transfer to athletic performance, such as sprint running (16) . Furthermore, because the hip thrust is performed such that the force vector is anteroposterior relative to the human body (Figure 1 ), the force vector hypothesis states that it may better transfer to sports that are dependent on horizontal force production, because, when standing, horizontal force vectors are anteroposterior. Sprinting is particularly relevant in this context, as horizontal force, horizontal force times horizontal velocity (often misappropriated as \"horizontal power\"), and horizontal impulse have strong associations with sprint running, both at maximal speed and during acceleration (7, 8, 35) . Randell et al. (41) proposed that training adaptations may be direction-specific and that anteroposteriorly loaded exercises may transfer better to horizontal force production, and vice versa for axially loaded exercises. To date, only one study has investigated the effects of the hip thrust exercise on performance (34) . The hip thrust (9, 25, 39, 47) . Since the squat has an axial force vector and the hip thrust has an anteroposterior force vector, it is possible that the hip thrust has stronger transference to sprint running, whereas the squat has stronger transference to the vertical jump. This is important, as the identification of how different exercises transfer optimally to sport performance is paramount for strength and conditioning exercise selection. Both deep front squats and deep back squats have been shown to lead to larger vertical jump improvements than shallow squats (24) . However, both the front squat and back squat have been shown to have similar muscle activation and hip moments (21, 51) . On the other hand, the hip thrust appears to activate the hip extensor musculature to a greater extent than the back squat (14) .",

Hip thrust within-group analyses revealed possibly to most likely beneficial effects for all outcomes. The large ES noted for hip thrust strength changes (d = 2.20) is in line with the principle of specificity. Clearly beneficial effects for the hip thrust group to improve front squat strength were noted (d = 0.64). Because the hip thrust has been shown to elicit similar quadriceps electromyographic (EMG) amplitude as compared with, and greater hip extensor EMG amplitude than, the squat, these results are intuitive (14) . The decreases in 10-m (d = 0.55) and 20-m (d = 1.14) sprint times are in line with the force vector hypothesis, as the hip thrust likely develops an anteroposterior force vector, and sprint performance is highly correlated with horizontal force output, which is directed anteroposteriorly (35) . Clearly beneficial effects in peak force during the isometric midthigh pull (d = 1.02; normalized d = 0.77) were observed as hypothesized. These effects are likely due to the position-specific adaptations of end-range hip extension, which is required during the isometric midthigh pull, in addition to the high EMG amplitudes of the hip and knee extensors during the hip thrust (14) . Finally, possibly beneficial effects in vertical (d = 0.43) and horizontal (d = 0.51) jump measures were observed, but with small-to-medium ES. These outcomes are likely due to the ability of the hip thrust to place mechanical demands on the hip and knee extensors (14) . In addition, large horizontal impulses are needed for horizontal jump distance (50) , so the anteroposterior force vector used in the hip thrust may be beneficial for improving horizontal force when upright, and thus, potentially horizontal impulse production, if time components do not change (or increase).",

This indicates that athletes that participate in sports like basketball and volleyball, which are predicated on vertical jump, may benefit more from the front squat rather than the hip thrust. However, in sports such as rugby and American football, it may be more beneficial for athletes to perform the hip thrust, because of its carryover to acceleration. Because the hip thrust does seem to increase front squat performance, it is possible that the hip thrust may be a viable option to perform during times of injury to maintain or increase front squat strength. The direction of the resistance force vector relative to the body appears to play a role in transference, in that axially resisted movements (front squat) appear to better transfer to vertical-based activities (vertical jump), and anteroposteriorresisted movements (hip thrust) appear to better transfer to horizontal-based activities (20-m sprint). The carryover of the hip thrust to peak isometric midthigh pull force is indicative that the hip thrust may have carryover to deadlift lockout, even though the positions are slightly different. Finally, it is likely best to perform a combination of movements rather than just one; it is recommended that athletes incorporate both the squat and hip thrust for complementary improvements in performance. Future studies are needed in adults and female populations, as these findings cannot be extrapolated.",

            "In line with previous literature, specificity is critical for improving the strength in a lift.",
            "This indicates that athletes that participate in sports like basketball and volleyball, which are predicated on vertical jump, may benefit more from the front squat rather than the hip thrust.",
            "However, in sports such as rugby and American football, it may be more beneficial for athletes to perform the hip thrust, because of its carryover to acceleration.",
            "Because the hip thrust does seem to increase front squat performance, it is possible that the hip thrust may be a viable option to perform during times of injury to maintain or increase front squat strength.",
            "The direction of the resistance force vector relative to the body appears to play a role in transference, in that axially resisted movements (front squat) appear to better transfer to vertical-based activities (vertical jump), and anteroposteriorresisted movements (hip thrust) appear to better transfer to horizontal-based activities (20-m sprint).",
            "The carryover of the hip thrust to peak isometric midthigh pull force is indicative that the hip thrust may have carryover to deadlift lockout, even though the positions are slightly different.",
            "Finally, it is likely best to perform a combination of movements rather than just one; it is recommended that athletes incorporate both the squat and hip thrust for complementary improvements in performance.",
            "Future studies are needed in adults and female populations, as these findings cannot be extrapolated."
