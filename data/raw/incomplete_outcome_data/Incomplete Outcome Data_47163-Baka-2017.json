The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nefopam on lactation and to investigate potential adverse effects on newborns. Methods: Seventy-two women, scheduled to undergo a caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia and wanting to breastfeed, were randomised to one of two groups: nefopam (20 mg, six hourly) or paracetamol (1 g, six hourly). In both groups, postoperative analgesia was supplemented with ketoprofen (50 mg, six hourly) in conjunction with intrathecal morphine 0.1 mg. The primary outcome was onset of lactation, estimated by weighing the newborns before and after feeding; by maternal perception of breast fullness and based on serum prolactin concentration 48 hours postpartum. Secondary outcomes were neonatal adverse effects evaluated by neurobehavioural score at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after birth. Statistical analyses were performed using Chi-squared, Fisher exact and Student t tests as appropriate. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The difference in the weight of the newborn before and after each feed, maternal perception of breast fullness and serum prolactin did not significantly differ between groups. The volume of artificial milk given to newborns of mothers in the nefopam group on days two and three was significantly greater than for the paracetamol group. Neurobehavioural scores were comparable at each time point. Conclusion: Nefopam does not appear to delay the onset of lactation or present any clear risk to the newborn.",

Its chemical structure, close to that of orphenadrine (an anti-muscarinic drug), explains its anticholinergic effects. 1 Animal studies have demonstrated its anti-nociceptive action at spinal and supraspinal levels by inhibition of the presynaptic reuptake of monoamines (dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine). [2] [3] [4] Its use in multimodal postoperative analgesic protocols provides an average morphine sparing effect of 13 mg [95% CI 8.5 to 17.9 mg] across a 24 hour period. 5 This effect is attributed to a synergistic effect with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 6 and an additive effect with paracetamol (acetaminophen). 7 Although widely used in postoperative acute pain after general surgery, its use after caesarean delivery is infrequent. A French study in an obstetric environment found that nefopam was used by 19% of centres, whereas paracetamol and NSAIDs were used by 98% and 68% of centres, respectively. 8 This low use of nefopam may be related to the theoretical concern about an inhibitory action on lactation, due to its anti-cholinergic and dopaminergic activity, and possible adverse effects on the newborn.",

Breastfeeding is a complex phenomenon, influenced by multiple factors such as parity, mode of delivery, obesity, 11, [16] [17] [18] and drugs administered intra-and postpartum. It requires high levels of maternal motivation, optimal newborn sucking, restriction of supplementary artificial milk administration, a stress-free environment and adequate post-operative analgesia for the mother. 11, 19, 20 The onset of lactation typically occurs between days two to four after delivery. Caesarean delivery is a recognised risk factor for a delay in onset of more than three days. 11 General anaesthesia may further delay the onset compared to spinal anaesthesia for caesarean delivery. 21 Prolactin is responsible for the establishment of lactation, the synthesis of milk (lactogenesis) and the maintenance of milk production (galactopoesis). 22, 23 Its inhibition leads to cessation of lactation. 24 Both basal and peak serum prolactin levels are related to breastfeeding, with peak concentrations 40-45 minutes after initiation and a return to normal 90 to 180 minutes later. The concentration decreases progressively between the first and the sixth month postpartum while milk secretion remains constant, suggesting an additional autocrine control mechanism. 25 There is also circadian variability, with the lowest levels occurring in the evening and the highest at night or early morning. 26, 27 Nefopam, via a central dopaminergic action on D2 receptors 4 and anti-muscarinic activity, may interfere with the secretion of prolactin and hence inhibit lactation.
