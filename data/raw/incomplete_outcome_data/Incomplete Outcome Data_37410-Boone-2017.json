Aims: This secondary analysis aimed to describe sensory profiles and explore effects of combined dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) supplementation on parent-reported sensory processing in toddlers born preterm who were exhibiting ASD symptoms. Study design: 90-day randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects: 31 children aged 18-38 months who were born at \u226429 weeks' gestation. Outcome measure: Mixed effects regression analyses followed intent to treat and explored effects on parentreported sensory processing measured by the Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile (ITSP). Results: Baseline ITSP scores reflected atypical sensory processing, with the majority of atypical scores falling below the mean. Sensory processing sections: auditory (above = 0%, below = 65%), vestibular (above = 13%, below = 48%), tactile (above = 3%, below = 35%), oral sensory (above = 10%; below = 26%), visual (above = 10%, below = 16%); sensory processing quadrants: low registration (above = 3%; below = 71%), sensation avoiding (above = 3%; below = 39%), sensory sensitivity (above = 3%; below = 35%), and sensation seeking (above = 10%; below = 19%). Twenty-eight of 31 children randomized had complete outcome data. Although not statistically significant (p = 0.13), the magnitude of the effect for reduction in behaviors associated with sensory sensitivity was medium to large (effect size = 0.57). No other scales reflected a similar magnitude of effect size (range: 0.10 to 0.32). Conclusions: The findings provide support for larger randomized trials of omega fatty acid supplementation for children at risk of sensory processing difficulties, especially those born preterm.",

        "text": "This study is the first to explore effects of omega fatty acid supplementation on parent-reported sensory processing in a sample of toddlers born at \u226429 weeks gestation who were exhibiting ASD symptoms during toddlerhood using a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled design. Although not statistically significant, there was a medium to large treatment effect in the sensory sensitivity domain. Specifically, children in the treatment group experienced a 0.46 point increase in sensory sensitivity raw scores (greater than half a standard deviation), while children in the placebo group experienced a 0.06 change in sensory sensitivity raw scores. The increase in raw scores is illustrative of a reduction in behaviors associated with sensory sensitivity. Children who demonstrate patterns of behavior consistent with sensory sensitivity are characterized as having low neurological thresholds and demonstrate high levels of distractibility and hyperactivity and have overactive neural systems, symptoms commonly associated with preterm birth [31, [44] [45] [46] [47] . The stressful NICU environment experienced by children born preterm may have lasting effects on the child's sensory processing capabilities in early childhood, which in turn may affect behavior and development and ultimately cause more stressful parent-child, and potentially teacher-child, interactions [9] . Therefore, evidence-based, targeted interventions to improve sensory processing in children are needed and may have lasting benefits for both the child and the family.",

Although this may limit the generalizability of the findings to all children or children who have an ASD diagnosis, the results of this study represent a very positive first step to elucidate readily available, cost-effective interventions for children at risk for sensory processing deficits. Because we drew our participants from a roster of all children who required NICU care, our source population was not subject to some of the participation bias seen in studies that rely purely on volunteers or patients of neonatal follow-up clinics. Thus, our findings may be more generalizable to the larger population of children born at \u226429 weeks' gestation who demonstrate ASD symptomology. Also, because parents were poor at correctly guessing their child's treatment assignment, we can rule out accidental unblinding or parent suspicions about their child's treatment assignment as an alternative explanation for why parents would report changes in their child's sensory processing capabilities. Finally, fish consumption in the sample did not differ between the treatment and placebo groups, and did not change from baseline to the final study visit. Therefore, change in eating habits resulting in increased omega fatty acid consumption can be ruled out as a potential explanation for changes in sensory processing.",
