J Strength Cond Res 31(12): 3295-3304, 2017-Previous studies contrasted the effects of plyometric training (PT) conducted on stable vs. unstable surfaces on components of physical fitness in child and adolescent soccer players. Depending on the training modality (stable vs. unstable), specific performance improvements were found for jump (stable PT) and balance performances (unstable PT). In an attempt to combine the effects of both training modalities, this study examined the effects of PT on stable surfaces compared with combined PT on stable and unstable surfaces on components of physical fitness in prepuberal male soccer athletes. Thirty-three boys were randomly assigned to either a PT on stable surfaces (PTS; n = 17; age = 12.1 6 0.5 years; height = 151.6 6 5.7 cm; body mass = 39.2 6 6.5 kg; and maturity offset = 22.3 6 0.5 years) or a combined PT on stable and unstable surfaces (PTC; n = 16; age = 12.2 6 0.6 years; height = 154.6 6 8.1 cm; body mass = 38.7 6 5.0 kg; and maturity offset = 22.2 6 0.6 years). Both intervention groups conducted 4 soccer-specific training sessions per week combined with either 2 PTS or PTC sessions. Before and after 8 weeks of training, proxies of muscle power (e.g., countermovement jump [CMJ], standing long jump [SLJ]), muscle strength (e.g., reactive strength index [RSI]), speed (e.g., 20-m sprint test), agility (e.g., modified Illinois change of direction test [MICODT]), static balance (e.g., stable stork balance test [SSBT]), and dynamic balance (unstable stork balance test [USBT]) were tested. An analysis of covariance model was used to test between-group differences (PTS vs. PTC) at posttest using baseline outcomes as covariates. No significant between-group differences at posttest were observed for CMJ (p. 0.05, d = 0.41), SLJ (p. 0.05, d = 0.36), RSI (p. 0.05, d = 0.57), 20-m sprint test (p. 0.05, d = 0.06), MICODT (p. 0.05, d = 0.23), and SSBT (p. 0.05, d = 0.20). However, statistically significant between-group differences at posttest were noted for the USBT (p , 0.01, d = 1.49) in favor of the PTC group. For most physical fitness tests (except RSI), significant pre-to-post improvements were observed for both groups (p , 0.01, d = 0.55-3.96). Eight weeks of PTS or PTC resulted in similar performance improvements in components of physical fitness except for dynamic balance. From a performance-enhancing perspective, PTC is recommended for pediatric strength and conditioning coaches because it produced comparable training effects as PTS on proxies of muscle power, muscle strength, speed, agility, static balance, and additional effects on dynamic balance.",

The 2 PT sessions were integrated into the regular training routine of the soccer team. The second PT session was completed 72 hours after the first one so as to provide a sufficient recovery period between sessions. Each session lasted between 80 and 90 minutes. The PT drills lasted between 25 and 30 minutes. The PT protocol was based on previously published recommendations for training intensity and volume from Bedoya et al. (3) . During every PT session, 2-footed ankle hops forward exercises and CMJs were performed. To limit stress on the musculotendinous unit, training volume and intensity were progressively increased ( Table 2) .

        "text": "Agility is an important performance determinant in team sports, particularly in soccer (2) . Findings of this study demonstrated similar MICODT improvements after both PT interventions. In previous studies, significant gains on measures of agility have been reported after PT. For instance, Ramirez-Campillo et al. (34) found significant increases in agility (D5.1%, p , 0.05) after 6 weeks of PTS using vertical and horizontal jump exercises in young male soccer players with a mean age of 11.2 6 2.3 years. In addition, Negra et al. (26) reported significant improvements in Illinois change of direction test performance after 8 (D2%, p , 0.05) and 12 (D3.3%, p , 0.01) weeks of PTS in prepuberal male soccer players. Likewise, Garcia-Pinillos et al. (12) observed better agility (D5%, p , 0.001) after 12 weeks of contrast training (isometric + plyometric) without external loads in young soccer players with a mean age of 15.9 6 1.43 years. In the same context, a recent study conducted by Negra et al. (28) demonstrated similar increases in the Illinois change of direction test after 8 weeks of either stable (D3%, p , 0.01) or unstable PT interventions (D3%, p , 0.01). Likewise, Granacher et al. (13) revealed a significant performance improvement in agility (D2.9%-3.1%, both p , 0.001) after 8 weeks of either stable or unstable PT in subelite adolescent male soccer players. The authors concluded that PT on unstable and Plyometric Training in Youth stable surfaces induced similar effects on agility performance in subelite adolescent soccer athletes. In agreement with the previous studies (13, 28) , the current results reported similar agility performance improvements in the 2 experimental groups. This means that both PT programs may have similarly improved both eccentric and concentric lower limb muscle strength, which is an important prerequisite to improving agility (1, 7) . In addition, the significant reduction in agility time performance showed that a plyometric program conducted either on stable or on combined surfaces can have a positive influence on a field test similar to gameplay and therefore may have an impact on true soccer performance. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, PTC did not have any additive effect on agility performance compared with PTS. In our study, PTC mainly contained horizontal and vertical jump exercises alternated on stable and highly unstable surfaces without performing any rapid change of direction exercises. This lack of training specificity may explain the absence of any extraeffect of PTC on agility. In this context, Young et al. (42) studied the effects of 6 weeks of sprint versus agility training in healthy and physically active men aged 24 6 5.7 years and revealed that the agility training group showed significant improvements in agility performance without producing any significant effect on linear sprint performance. Overall, improvements in agility performance may be attributed to neuromuscular adaptations associated with firing frequencies and patterns that enable athletes to rapidly switch between deceleration and acceleration motions (16) .",

            "Likewise, Garcia-Pinillos et al. (12) observed better agility (D5%, p , 0.001) after 12 weeks of contrast training (isometric + plyometric) without external loads in young soccer players with a mean age of 15.9 6 1.43 years.",
            "In the same context, a recent study conducted by Negra et al. (28) demonstrated similar increases in the Illinois change of direction test after 8 weeks of either stable (D3%, p , 0.01) or unstable PT interventions (D3%, p , 0.01).",
            "Likewise, Granacher et al. (13) revealed a significant performance improvement in agility (D2.9%-3.1%, both p , 0.001) after 8 weeks of either stable or unstable PT in subelite adolescent male soccer players.",
            "The authors concluded that PT on unstable and Plyometric Training in Youth stable surfaces induced similar effects on agility performance in subelite adolescent soccer athletes.",
            "In agreement with the previous studies (13, 28) , the current results reported similar agility performance improvements in the 2 experimental groups.",
            "This means that both PT programs may have similarly improved both eccentric and concentric lower limb muscle strength, which is an important prerequisite to improving agility (1, 7) .",
            "In addition, the significant reduction in agility time performance showed that a plyometric program conducted either on stable or on combined surfaces can have a positive influence on a field test similar to gameplay and therefore may have an impact on true soccer performance.",
            "However, in contrast to our hypothesis, PTC did not have any additive effect on agility performance compared with PTS.",
            "In our study, PTC mainly contained horizontal and vertical jump exercises alternated on stable and highly unstable surfaces without performing any rapid change of direction exercises.",
            "This lack of training specificity may explain the absence of any extraeffect of PTC on agility.",
            "In this context, Young et al. (42) studied the effects of 6 weeks of sprint versus agility training in healthy and physically active men aged 24 6 5.7 years and revealed that the agility training group showed significant improvements in agility performance without producing any significant effect on linear sprint performance.",
            "Overall, improvements in agility performance may be attributed to neuromuscular adaptations associated with firing frequencies and patterns that enable athletes to rapidly switch between deceleration and acceleration motions (16) ."

However, only the PTC program induced greater dynamic balance gains at posttest compared with PTS. Of note, Negra et al. (28) recently observed a significant performance enhancement on measures of static balance (D121% and 149% for SSBT and USBT, respectively, both p , 0.01) after 8 weeks of PT on unstable surfaces in prepuberal soccer athletes. However, Negra et al. (28) did not find any significant improvement on measures of static balance after the same period of PTS. Yet, in adolescent soccer athletes, Granacher et al. (13) did not detect any significant difference between stable and unstable PT groups regarding the measures of static balance (i.e., 1-legged balance). These somewhat contradictory findings seem to be most likely due to differences in the applied training programs. Although Granacher et al. (13) conducted mainly vertical jump exercises, we included vertical and horizontal exercises in this study. In addition, the applied balance tests were different in these studies. Granacher et al. (13) assessed total center of pressure displacements during 1-legged stance on a force plate. We performed the stork balance test for performance assessment. Finally, subject characteristics were different in the 2 studies. Although Granacher et al. (13) examined adolescent athletes, we studied prepuberal soccer athletes. In summary and with reference to the results of this study, it is recom-mended to conduct PTC in youth soccer if the goal is to specifically enhance dynamic balance and other components of physical fitness (e.g., muscle power).",
