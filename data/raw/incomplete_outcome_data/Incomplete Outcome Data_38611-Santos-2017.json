This study's purpose was twofold: first, it intended to identify the effects of the Skills4-Genius sports-bases training program in thinking, motor, and in-game creative behavior in team sports. Second, it aimed to investigate the relationship between creative thinking and in-game creativity. Forty children from primary school were allocated into control (n = 18, age: 9.2\u00b10.4) and experimental (n = 22, age: 9.5\u00b10.7) groups. The experimental group participated in a five-month training program involving either creative thinking, diversification, physical literacy, and nonlinear pedagogy approaches (Skills4Genius). Variables in the study included: a) creative thinking; b) motor performance (vertical jump, speed, and agility); c) in-game individual creative behavior (attempts, fluency, and versatility); and d) in-game collective behavior (positional regularity). The results suggested that the Skills4Genius program fostered creative thinking, agility, and speed performance. Moreover, it stretched the in-game individual creative behavior mainly through the improvement of the attempts and versatility of the player's actions. Lastly, it nurtured a better learning of the tactical principles, whereas the children were more coordinated with their teammates' and opponents' positioning. Additionally, this study presents a positive correlation linking creative thinking and ingame creative performance. These findings highlighted that creativity is facilitated while players become more thinking and game-skilled. Coaches and educators may apply this functional environment to inspire children's disposition to move outside the box and trigger a creative spark in team sports players. Notwithstanding, the sports environment is ideally suited for fostering creative behavior, a higher-order disposition that will go on to differentiate the everyday life of a child.",

The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking has been translated into over 35 languages and is widely recognized and referenced as a valid and reliable instrument of creative thinking assessment [40] . The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking-Figural was comprised of the following three activities, all of which required unusual drawings that have standard shapes as parts: a) draw a picture, using a pear or jelly bean shape provided on the page as a stimulus; b) finish a drawing, using ten incomplete figures to make a completed object or picture; and c) compose a different drawing using parallel lines, where children used three pages of lines to create pictures [41] . Moreover, each drawing was scored using five subscales: fluency; elaboration; originality; resistance to premature closure (closure); abstractness of titles (titles); and also 13 creative personality traits that comprise the students' creative strengths. Fluency is the ability to produce a large number of figural images. Elaboration reflects the participant's ability to apply details in order to extend an idea. Originality represents the ability to produce unusual, unexpected, yet relevant ideas as determined by statistical infrequency. Resistance to premature closure is based on the conclusion that creative behavior requires a person to keep an open mind while processing information. Abstractness of titles is based on the idea that creativity requires an abstraction of thought, and measures the degree in which a title moves beyond concrete labeling of the pictures drawn [41] . The sum of these five norm-referenced scores make up the creativity score, which is an indicator of creative potential.",

This test involved the participants lowering themselves from an upright standing position until approximating a knee angle of 90 degrees, followed immediately by a vertical jump as high as possible. They were allowed to swing their arms freely. Moreover, the anaerobic performance was evaluated using a straight sprint test. Participants were instructed to run as fast as possible along the 15m distance from a standing-start position. The agility assessment was evaluated through a modified agility T-test and its reliability was outlined by Sassi and colleagues [42] . The modified agility T-test preserved the same nature of displacement of the Ttest, except for the measures of intercone distance that was reduced to be more representative of team sports requirements. The participants started each trail from a standing position 0.5m behind the sensor with both of their feet behind the starting point. On command, the participants: 1) sprinted 5m forward to the center cone and touched the top of it with their right hand; 2) sidestepped 2.5m to the left cone and touched its top with the left hand; 3) sidestepped 5m to the far right cone; 4) sidestepped back to the left to the center cone; and then 5) ran 5m backward to the finish line.

Then, the individual creative behavior was assessed through a computerized notational analysis using Simi Scout software (version 2.0.0.174, Simi Reality Motion Systems GmbH, 2007, Unterschleissheim, Germany). To evaluate the offensive technical creativity in ball possession, the data provided by the Simi Scout Software was organized in a designed Excel for Windows 1 spreadsheet entitled Creativity Behavior Assessment in Team Sports (CBATS). Measurements included pass, dribble and shot and the examination of participants' actions was divided into successful and unsuccessful [43] . Further, the previous technical-tactical variables were classified according to creativity components, which was derived from creativity research and adapted to the sport contexts [1] . The creativity components assessed established a creative behavior score: a) attempts, recognized as any effort to perform different actions, even in unsuccessful movements; b) fluency, or the ability to execute as many successful movement actions as possible; and c) versatility, which was identified as the ability to generate a diversity of actions, such as executing different forms to pass or shoot. Thus, attempts were considered the unsuccessful actions, while the fluency and versatility comprised the successful actions. A detailed description of the variables observed using the CBATS are presented in the S1 Table. The CBTAS enabled us to automatically carry out the calculations of the individual technical-tactical variables (attempts, fluency, and versatility) to determine a final score. The S2 Table provides a simplified example of the CBATS' structure. Thus, the sum of fluent actions for the pass, dribble and shot result in the total score of fluency and the same process was occurred with attempts and versatility. Moreover, the previous variables were assessed considering absolute values of occurrence (frequency). Additionally, the present study address the exploratory behavior as a concept that combine the attempts, fluency and versatile actions. An experienced sport performance analyst gathered the data and reliability was inspected by retesting 17.5% of the sample one week later, calculating the attempts, fluency and versatility for the pass, dribble and shot.

Indeed, the domain of the fundamental motor skills proved useful to enhance a game-related performance [16, 22] . In this regard, the Skills4Genius training program revealed their effectiveness in speed and agility development. These outcomes can be explained by the moderate contextual interference induced by the enrichment program [53, 54] . Further, it is important to stress that the program adopted pre-planned activities and small-sided games formats derived from the TGfU approach. Our results are in line with Chaouachi and colleagues' standpoint [55] , which refers to cumulative effects of combining both types of training having a positive impact in speed and agility enhancement. However, agility presented a better improvement trend. Recently, it was pointed out that training grounded in small-sided games forms is an alternative for agility development [55] [56] [57] [58] . Table 3 . Inferential statistics of thinking and game pre-post variation and the coefficient correlation between pre-pre and pre-post of the control and experimental groups. Otherwise, the training program was not effective in the vertical jump improvement, even with plyometric tasks [59, 60] . Possibly, low doses of concentrated plyometric training (focused in vertical and horizontal force vectors) provided by pre-planned activities are not enough to induce any adaptation. Moreover, studies report that children from the ages of 9 to 10 years old are not in an optimal window of trainability [61] . Additionally, the Skills4Genius training program encouraged children to expand their sports participation to more game-related behaviors. It is well-known that particularly in team sports, players are required to simultaneously perceive relevant game-information (such as the positions and movements of teammates and opponents), and then deliberately explore a novel action [1] . Our results confirmed that the program enhanced the children's individual exploratory behavior during the game, through the improvement of their attempts, fluency, and versatility. Note that children's efforts to diversify their technical-tactical skills during the game, even unsuccessfully (versatility and attempts), were the main components stressed by the program. This was tested instead of the stretching of their standardized ability to respond successfully (fluency). In fact, the mastery of the fundamental sport skills allows players to explore and improvise without limits, which is a precondition of player's creativity [27, 28, 62] . Conversely to the technical-tactical variability presented in individual performance, the distance to team centroid and distance to opponent team centroid, both positional variables revealed a high regularity (more repeatable movement patterns), indicating the emergence of functional and adaptive movements in the experimental group. It seems that the training program nurtures a better learning about fundamental tactical principles related to space occupation, whereas the children were more coordinated with their teammates' and opponents' positioning. This intentional positional adjustment occurred as a result of the players' game perceptions, revealing a better understanding of the game [46] . Team sports creativity is extremely dependent on the interaction of all elements (teammates and opponents), which leads to the shared creation processes. For that, players should develop a consciousness of the environment changes to dynamically and continually coordinate their actions [23] . Therefore, the technical variability did not impair the game regularity, in turn, it seems that positional adjustments were facilitated while players become more skilled.",

Possibly, the nonsport initial activities arouse creative thinking incubation and inspire the children's disposition to explore new solutions during the remaining sporting session. Moreover, it could be speculated that variability demands provided by diversification, embodied in nonlinearity, nurtures great effects in children's capacity to adjust motor actions and encourages players to unlock their creative potential. Both types of practice provide freedom to experiment and produce a variety of novel motion configurations, which in turn, gives the children the opportunity to explore and adapt continuously [14, 26, 31, 37] . The game situations presented at the end of the training session (i.e., games simultaneously played with hands and feet, like handball coupled with football) are an accurate example of how to promote variability and unpredictable demands. The noise provided by the task constraints manipulation in these game-centred approaches, also promotes the exploratory behavior [29, 63] . Still, these ecological settings allow children to become more proficient at perceiving environment cues and constant changes in game situations, while learning the fundamental tactical principles, explaining in part, the reported trend in the collective positional behavior. Undoubtedly, children should be encouraged to develop game understanding and tactical consciousness [31] . Notwithstanding, children's perceptual and action adaptability seems to be provided by the improvement in the breadth of attention. Players need a wide breadth of attention in order to generate tactical behavior and seek for different solutions [32] . The enhancement of the ability to attune the relevant information in team sports was also observed in an earlier creativity program [12] . Indeed, the creativity development is facilitated while players become more skilled and have acquire better attentional abilities [64] .",

In the pre-test measurements this correlation was very strong, clearly revealing a positive interdependence. Nevertheless, the correlation decreased after the training program application or 5 months later. Apparently, the step decline in the creative thinking and the continuously improvement in the sport-specific creativity explains the higher variation in the control group correlation. Indeed, at this age a slump in the creative thinking occurs. However this tendency was not verified in the game performance. While the creative thinking was not stimulated, instead the fundamental game skills increased by the physical education commitment creating an unevenness between both variables. On the other hand, despite the thinking and game increasing in the experimental group, the correlation slightly decreased. This trend could be explained by the unbalanced thinking and game development. As expected, children improved more game skills rather than thinking abilities, which was not surprising since the enrichment program structure was essentially composed of sport activities. In fact, these results suggest that it is also important to nurture thinking abilities in sports training programs to form openminded players who exploit all available creative possibilities in the field. As well as, avoided the potential creativity decreased with age. According to the previous connections, the program also provided a lack of improvement in the fluency scores, either in thinking and ingame creativity. This trend may indicates a strong relation between thinking and game creative behavior, since exactly the same components were less stressed. Thus, in forthcoming training programs this issue should assume more attention. Surely, further research is required in this domain to understand the variation in the creative thinking and sport-specific creativity during the life course, and to what extent they complement each other. Further, the impact of enrichment programs in distinct age groups should be considered. Additionally, it is important to overcome a few limitations related with the homogeneity of groups and also carefully control the developmental level of the participants in several domains (maturation, cognition and motor skills). Overall, this insightful study recognizes that environmental interference induced by the training program, can be used to optimize the thinking, motor, and in-game performance in children without previous experience in sports, supporting the development of players' creativity. Under these practice conditions, the program fosters skillfulness behaviors that play an important role in triggering a creative spark in team sports players.",
