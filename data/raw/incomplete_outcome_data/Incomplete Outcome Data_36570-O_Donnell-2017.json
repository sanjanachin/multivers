This study compared the efficacy of family-focused therapy for adolescents (FFT-A) plus pharmacotherapy to brief psychoeducation (enhanced care, or EC) plus pharmacotherapy on self-rated QoL in adolescents with BD over 2 years. Methods: Participants were 141 adolescents (mean age: 15.6 \u00b1 1.4yr) with BD I or II who had a mood episode in the previous 3 months. Adolescents and parents were randomly assigned to (1) FFT-A, given in 21 sessions in 9 months of psychoeducation, communication enhancement training, and problem-solving skills training, or (2) EC, given in 3 family psychoeducation sessions. Study psychiatrists provided patient participants with protocolbased pharmacotherapy for the duration of the study. QoL was assessed with The KINDL R Questionnaire (Ravens-Sieberer and Bullinger, 1998) during active treatment (baseline to 9 months) and during a post-treatment followup (9-24 months). Results: The two treatment groups did not differ in overall QoL scores over 24 months. However, adolescents in FFT-A had greater improvements in quality of family relationships and physical well-being than participants in EC. For quality of friendships, the trajectory during active treatment favored EC, whereas the trajectory during post-treatment favored FFT-A. Limitations: We were unable to standardize medication use or adherence over time. Quality of life was based on self-report rather than on observable functioning. Conclusions: A short course of family psychoeducation and skills training may enhance relational functioning and health in adolescents with BD. The effects of different psychosocial interventions on peer relationships deserves further study.",

Our findings also indicate that FFT-A may have a greater impact than EC on QoL related to family life during treatment, and physical well-being in the intervals after treatment. FFT-A encourages skill development (e.g. positive communication, negotiating conflict, effective problem-solving) to mitigate family conflict and parent/offspring criticism, and may reduce the putative effects of these contextual variables on the adolescents' mood stability and the family's well-being. However, we emphasize that Quality of Family Life scores were greater for the FFT group only during the active treatment phase, with a leveling off in scores for both groups following treatment. It may be that active engagement in treatment provides greater opportunities to practice skill development (i.e. communication, problem solving) between family members during sessions, whereas families are less likely to employ these skills once the treatment sessions have ended. Clinical protocols that encourage family members and patients to continue practicing these skills after treatment (e.g. periodic booster sessions, ongoing assessment of skill use) may help to maintain the positive trajectory of Quality of Family Life scores. In addition, FFT-A places a greater emphasis than EC on enhancing positive coping techniques (e.g., medication adherence, exercise, regular sleep/wake cycles) to reduce one's vulnerability to mood changes. Incorporating healthier lifestyle choices during treatment may lead to an improvement in one's sense of physical well-being following treatment. It is worth noting that adults with BD rank social support and physical health as the most important determinants of QoL (Michalak et al., 2006) .",

        "text": "One unexpected finding was that during the active treatment period, adolescents with BD reported greater improvements in friendships after receiving EC than during FFT-A. In a trial of FFT in adolescents and young adults at risk for psychosis, age moderated the effects of FFT vs. EC on social and role functioning: older adolescents (aged 16-19 years) reported greater improvements in functioning over 6 months if their families received 3 sessions of psychoeducation than if their families received 18 sessions of FFT (Miklowitz et al., 2014a) . Young adults (ages 20 and up) with prodromal psychosis showed higher 6-month functioning scores if they had received FFT than EC. For the specific area of making and maintaining friendships, adolescents may respond better to a brief psychoeducational program with more emphasis on peer relationships and less emphasis on family relationships. Notably, during the post-treatment phase, youth who received FFT-A showed greater improvements in friendship quality than those in EC, such that participants in the two groups had equivalent Friendship scores at the 24-month assessment. Thus, the timing of changes in peer functioning may vary across these two treatments. For those in the more extensive FFT-A program, incorporation of communication and problem-solving skills into one's social network may be necessary before improvements in peer functioning can be observed.",
