Materials and Methods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted among 214 parents or caregivers and their children at Health Centre 54, Bangkok, Thailand, from September 2015 to February 2016. The participants were randomised to the intervention and the control groups (107 participants per group). At baseline, the intervention group received a caries risk assessment, individual counseling by using motivational interviewing, and oral hygiene instruction. The intervention group received reinforcement education and individual counseling by motivational interviewing every 3 months. The control group received a routine programme. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months for plaque index and caries. The data were analysed by using descriptive statistics, the chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, t-test, repeated-measures ANOVA, and negative binomial distribution. Results: After the 6-month follow-up, participants in the intervention group had a significantly lower plaque index, non-cavitated plus cavitated carious lesions, and cavitated carious lesions when compared to the control group. The intervention group had a lower caries incidence, non-cavitated plus cavitated carious lesions (1.81 times) and cavitated carious lesions (2.04 times) than the control group. Conclusion: The combination of motivational interviewing and caries risk assessment in one programme decreased early childhood caries in preschool children. It is not known whether the effects are due to the motivational interviewing, the caries risk assessment, or the combination of both.",

        "text": "E arly childhood caries (ECC) is a major health concern that continues to negatively affect the oral health of children. Its consequences can affect the immediate and longterm quality of life of the child's family. 3 Children with ECC may suffer both physical and developmental difficulties, including pain, tooth loss, malocclusion, malnutrition, sleep disruptions, speech problems, and suboptimal social development. 3 ECC is one of the most important problems in both developed and developing countries. 3, 14 In Thailand, the National Oral Health Survey conducted in 2012 found that 51.7% of 3-year-olds had ECC. 5 The risk of ECC could be reduced by preventing maternal bacterial transmission to the child, diet counseling, and the use of fluoride. 3 Twice daily toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste is one of the most inexpensive and effective methods to reduce the risk of ECC. 3, 8 Oral health intervention programmes, including fluoride varnish application, daily tooth cleaning with toothpaste, and promoting dental health in community settings have been shown to be efficacious in preventing dental caries in young children. 16, 20 However, clinical prevention and oral health education could not prevent ECC in the long term. 21 Motivational Interviewing (MI) interventions were found to be the most effective method for altering health behaviours in a clinical setting. 21 MI is a brief counseling technique focussed on the individual that uses an empathic, collaborative style to elicit and build on patients' own reasons for change. 12 MI has proven efficacy with a range of health-related behaviours, including diet and exercise, substance abuse, and medication adherence. 7 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of MI in promoting the oral health of children. 15 A systematic review of randomised controlled Saengtipbovorn trials showed variable success of MI in improving oral health. 6 For instance, Ismail et al 9 found that one single motivational interview only changed some reported oral health behaviours, and failed to reduce the new number of untreated carious lesions. 9 The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) has published a guideline on the periodicity of examination, preventive dental services, anticipatory guidance/counseling, and oral treatment for infants, children, and adolescents. It includes oral examination, caries risk assessment, topical fluoride application, systemic fluoride application, oral health education, and counseling. 1 Caries risk assessment is a key element of contemporary preventive care for infants, children, adolescents, and persons with special health care needs. Its goal is to prevent disease by identifying and minimising causative factors and optimising protective factors. It guides the dentist in the decision-making process to establish treatment and prevention protocols for children. 4 The results on MI's ability to prevent ECC are inconsistent, whereas caries risk assessment has been used successfully to prevent caries by identifying and minimising causative factors, optimising protective factors, and helping in the decision-making process. Thus, combining MI's advantages of building on the patients' own reasons for change as well as providing more frequent MI sessions with caries risk assessment to guide the dentist in the decisionmaking process may be needed to prevent ECC. The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of Motivational Interviewing plus Caries Risk Assessment (MICRA programme) to improve the dental health status of preschool children.",

Dental health status was improved and sustained up to the 6-month follow-up. Moreover, this programme decreased caries incidence when compared to the control group. The efficacy of MICRA in the present study is consistent with previous studies in other countries, which found that fluoride varnish application, oral health education of the parents and increased cooperation with the community decreased ECC. 16, 20 In contrast, a study in Thailand found that fluoride varnish application nonsignificantly decreased ECC. 17 This may be explained by a lack of oral hygiene instruction to parents or caregivers. An interesting finding in the present study was that mean differences of PI were statistically significant at both the 3-and 6-month follow-up, whereas mean differences of caries (non-cavitated plus cavitated carious lesions, and cavitated carious lesions) were statistically significant only at the 6-month follow-up. This may be explained by the development of caries. The effect size (the magnitude of the impact on caries) found in the present study is higher than that reported in a previous study, 16 which showed that health promotion and fluoride varnish decreased caries incidence by 24% to 36%. Another study found dental counseling and fluoride varnish to decrease caries incidence by a factor of 2.20 compared to dental counseling alone, which is similar to the effect size in the present study. 20 The results of the present study reaffirm previous results of MI in improving oral health. 6, 15 This study showed that reinforcement MI improved dental health status, but other authors found that single motivational interviewing only changed some reported oral health behaviours. 9 Furthermore, the current study confirms earlier results of caries risk assessment, in which caries risk assessment reduced ECC in high-risk children. 10, 11 The strengths of the current study are its high response rate (91.6%) and the use of biomarkers, including PI and caries, to examine the outcomes. The major limitation of the present study was a lack of other groups in which participants only received caries risk assessment, so it is unknown whether the effects observed here are due to the caries risk assessment, the MI (or the reinforcement sessions of MI), or a combination of both. Furthermore, a selection bias from the willingness to participate, no monitoring of intervention fidelity, and not controlling for extra time spent with a dental hygienist also limit the present study and the interpretation of the data. The efficacy and acceptance of the MICRA programme are such that it can be implemented in the work routine of staff at the health centres.
