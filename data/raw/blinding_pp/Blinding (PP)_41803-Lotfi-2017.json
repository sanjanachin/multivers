        "text": "Balance function has been reported to be worse in ADHD children than in their normal peers. The present study hypothesized that an improvement in balance could result in better cognitive performance in children with ADHD and concurrent vestibular impairment. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of comprehensive vestibular rehabilitation therapy on the cognitive performance of children with combined ADHD and concurrent vestibular impairment. Methods: Subject were 54 children with combined ADHD. Those with severe vestibular impairment (n = 33) were randomly assigned to two groups that were matched for age. A rehabilitation program comprising overall balance and gate, postural stability, and eye movement exercises was assigned to the intervention group. Subjects in the control group received no intervention for the same time period. Intervention was administered twice weekly for 12 weeks. Choice reaction time (CRT) and spatial working memory (SWM) subtypes of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were completed pre-and postintervention to determine the effects of vestibular rehabilitation on the cognitive performance of the subjects with ADHD and concurrent vestibular impairment. ANCOVA was used to compare the test results of the intervention and control group post-test. Results: The percentage of correct trial scores for the CRT achieved by the intervention group posttest increased significantly compared to those of the control group (p = 0.029). The CRT mean latency scores were significantly prolonged in the intervention group following intervention (p = 0.007) compared to the control group. No significant change was found in spatial functioning of the subjects with ADHD following 12 weeks of intervention (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The study highlights the effect of vestibular rehabilitation on the cognitive performance of children with combined ADHD and concurrent vestibular disorder. The findings $ This study has been registered and approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences (USWR) as No.",

A binocular infrared goggle containing a cover to darken the area around the eyes, which was capable of tracking at 105 Hz, was used to record eye movements. Each child was given 2 min to adapt to the dark environment, following which instructions were provided again. The child was fastened to the chair using a safety belt around the chest and feet, and the head was stabilized in a head rest for an optimal upright position within a 30-degree angle. The child was instructed to perform mental tasks with the eyes open in complete darkness. The task required the child to name his/her classmates, animals, and objects. In each subtest, physiological nystagmus resulting from chair rotation was recorded and monitored using infrared cameras. We conducted the SHA subtype of the rotary chair test at the following frequencies: 0.01, 0.02, 0.08, 0.16, and 0.32 Hz. The evaluated response parameters included the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) gain, phase, and asymmetry. cVEMP waveforms were recorded using the Eclipse EP25 (version 4.1, Interacoustics, Denmark) with disposable surface electrodes. For cVEMP testing, the child was sat on a supported chair and was asked to bend his/her head by 30 and turn it toward the opposite side of the stimulated ear for sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle contraction. cVEMP tracings were obtained in the form of biphasic waveforms (positivenegative). The results were recorded after monaural stimulations. Rarefaction tone burst stimuli were used at 95 dB nHL. In total, 200 stimuli at 500 Hz (1-2-1 ms) with a stimulation rate of 5.1/s were presented through an Etymotic ER-3 insert phone. The analysis window was 50 ms. The response was band passfiltered (20-2000 Hz) and amplified (5000 times). The inverting electrodes were placed on the upper part of the SCM muscle on both sides, a noninverting electrode was placed on the edge of the sternum, and a ground electrode was set on the forehead. We used the Eclipse EP 25 Built-in EMG monitoring device (Interacoustics, Denmark) to control muscle contractions on both sides. The evaluated cVEMP parameters included the latency, amplitude, threshold, and amplitude ratio.",
