        "text": "Background: Local anesthetic infiltration and corticosteroids had shown effectiveness in reducing post tonsillectomy nausea, vomiting and pain. Objectives: To compare the effect of intravenous dexamethasone versus pre-incision infiltration of local anesthesia in pediatric tonsillectomy on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The secondary objective was postoperative pain. Methods: A randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Children admitted to undergo tonsillectomy aged between 4 and 13 years from January 2015 to August 2015 were enrolled and divided into two groups. Both groups had general anesthesia. Group I received intravenous dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose 16 mg) with placebo pre-incision infiltration. Group II received pre-incision infiltration a total of 2e4 ml local anesthesia mixture with saline and an equivalent volume of intravenous saline. Results: Group I consisted of 64 patients while group II had 65 patients. In the PACU, 15.6% of patients in group I experienced vomiting compared to 3.1% in group II (p-value \u00bc 0.032). After 24 h, the incidence of PONV was significantly higher in group I compared to group II (26.6% vs. 9.2% respectively, pvalue \u00bc 0.019). At 48 h postoperatively, PONV was significantly higher in group I (p-value \u00bc 0.013). The incidence was similar in both groups after three, four and five postoperative days. Baseline pain and pain during swallowing were significantly different at 6, 12 and 24 h as well as days 1 through 5. Pain upon jaw opening was significantly different at 6, 12 and 24 h between the two groups. Pain while eating soft food was significantly different at 24 h and days 2 through 5. In the PACU, 20.3% of patients in group I received diclofenac compared to 3.1% in group II (pvalue \u00bc 0.005). From day 1 till day 5, analgesic consumption was significantly higher in group I. Conclusion: Local anesthetic infiltration in addition to NSAIDS and paracetamol could serve as a multimodal analgesia and decrease PONV. Trial registration: NCT02355678.",

However, in the present study, the results showed a relation between PONV and pain. Higher pain scores were associated with more PONV. Upon analyzing the data of patients who had pain, we found that they were the same patients who had PONV. This could indicate that proper management of postoperative pain might decrease the incidence of PONV. Consequently, less PONV would improve oral intake and prevent dehydration; thereby reduce time to return to normal activity. Further studies are required to assess the effect of pain on PONV. Nevertheless, the local infiltration technique in addition to NSAIDs and paracetamol could serve as a multimodal analgesia and decrease PONV. ",
