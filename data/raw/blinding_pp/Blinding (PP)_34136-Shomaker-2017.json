        "text": "Therefore, we hypothesized that decreasing depressive symptoms during adolescence would prevent deterioration of insulin sensitivity in adolescents at risk for T2D. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (Shomaker et al., 2016) to determine if a six-session weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention designed to decrease depressive symptoms would prevent worsening of insulin sensitivity better than a health education (HE) standardof-care control program among adolescent females at risk for T2D who also had symptoms of depression. A preliminary report of the immediate six-week post-intervention results showed that adolescents in both groups decreased depressive symptoms (Shomaker et al., 2016) . Across groups, decreases in depressive symptoms were associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity. Among adolescents who had moderate (vs. mild) depressive symptoms, CBT produced greater decreases in depressive symptoms than HE. Insulin sensitivity remained stable in all participants during this short-term interval. In the current paper, we report changes in the primary efficacy outcome of insulin sensitivity over one year of follow-up. Adolescence is a dynamic period of the lifespan marked by major changes in social, psychological, neural, and biological domains (Steinberg, 2014) . Previous longitudinal studies of this age group illustrate that depressive symptoms exert an effect on insulin resistance over the long-term (e.g., up to five years later), likely through a cascade of effects on stress-related behavior and physiology (Shomaker et al., 2011) . In previous intervention studies, the impact of decreasing psychological symptoms on physical growth and endocrine outcomes frequently manifests to an increasingly greater extent as development unfolds over a longer-term follow-up interval, such as 1-3 years (versus directly after treatment) (Tanofsky-Kraff et al., 2016) . We, therefore, anticipated that there would be more apparent metabolic benefits of CBT, compared to HE, over the longer oneyear follow-up.",

Analyses were conducted with SPSS 23 (IBM, 2015) and SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Incorporated, 2011). The intent-to-treat sample consisted of participants who were randomized, regardless of whether they withdrew or were excluded after randomization. A priori, individuals who developed an exclusion criterion, including pregnancy, medication use (e.g., stimulants, anti-depressants, or insulin sensitizers), or regular psychotherapy, were withdrawn during the follow-up phase, so that any observed effects were not confounded by these variables. The intent-to-treat sample included the data from these participants to the point at which they were withdrawn, and missing data were imputed. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate baseline predictors of one-year attrition. ANCOVAs were conducted to characterize one-year change from baseline in depressive symptoms, BMI (kg/m 2 ), and fat mass (kg) by group. In these models, we adjusted for baseline depressive symptoms, BMI or fat mass, and time to follow-up, baseline age, pubertal status, degree of diabetes family history, race/ethnicity, and group facilitator. We also accounted for baseline BMIz in models predicting change in depressive symptoms and fat mass. Parallel ANCOVAs were conducted with the primary outcome of one-year insulin sensitivity change as the dependent variable and group as the independent variable. Covariates included baseline insulin sensitivity, baseline fat mass, baseline to post-treatment fat mass change, time to follow-up, baseline BMIz, age, pubertal status, diabetes family history, race/ethnicity, and facilitator. Parallel ANCOVAs evaluated secondary outcomes of changes in HOMA-IR, fasting and two-hour insulin and glucose. Multiple imputation using Monte Carlo Markov chain method in SAS PROC MI with 20 imputed data sets was used to handle missing data. We also conducted analyses with complete data using listwise deletion. Analyses were conducted for the entire sample and for the subset with baseline moderate depressive symptoms, because this subset had greater post-treatment decreases directly after CBT versus HE (Shomaker et al., 2016) .
