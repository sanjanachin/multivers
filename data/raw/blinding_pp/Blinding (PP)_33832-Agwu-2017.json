Results Thirty-three perinatally acquired YLHIV participants (16 continuing cART and 17 3TC/FTC) enrolled in the study. The median age, entry CD4 + T cell count, and viral load were 15 years (Inter-quartile range (IQR) 14-20), 472 cells/mm 3 (IQR 384-651), and 4.0 log 10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (IQR 3.2-4.5), respectively. Five participants, all in the 3TC/FTC arm, reached the primary endpoint for absolute CD4 + T cell decline (p = 0.02, exact log-rank test comparing monotherapy to cART). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of probability of primary endpoint on 3TC/FTC at 28 weeks was 0.41 (standard error 0.14).

Conclusions Non-adherent participants randomized to 3TC/FTC were more likely than those maintained on failing cART to experience a confirmed decline in CD4+ count of !30%. Although this study suffers from limitations of small sample size and premature discontinuation, the randomized comparison to continuing failing cART indicates that 3TC/FTC provides inferior protection from immunologic deterioration for non-adherent youth with M184V resistance.

However, during the time providers are working to improve adherence, nonadherence frequently continues with the attendant risk of accumulation of ARV drug resistance and reduction of future treatment options. The question of what to do with the cART while working on adherence remains a centrally important one in the management of persistently nonadherent children and youth living with PA-HIV in need of therapy and there are no consensus guidelines about how this should be managed. Switching to a new regimen in the setting of nonadherence, particularly, when nonadherence is unrelated to side effects, may lead to development of resistance to the new regimen. Discontinuation of cART is generally avoided in patients who meet treatment criteria, in light of data from the SMART study that highlights the increased morbidity risk secondary to HIV-related and non-related clinical events with treatment discontinuation [11] . Bridging strategies, without resistance consequences, could provide time for intensive efforts to improve adherence, which might improve the chance that these patients would succeed on a subsequent cART regimen. One such strategy is lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) monotherapy. The rationale for this strategy is as follows: 1) 3TC or FTC are components of the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of most first line cART regimens, 2) 3TC and FTC have minimal side effects, 3) the M184V resistance mutation, resulting in highlevel drug resistance to both 3TC and FTC, develops rapidly in the setting of nonadherence and is present in many treatment-experienced children and adolescents with PA-HIV [7, 12, 13] , 4) the M184V resistant mutation reduces viral fitness, and has been associated with a reduction in viral load of approximately 0.5 log 10 c/mL [14] , and 5) it does not confer significant cross-resistance to other NRTIs and increases susceptibility of HIV to other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs [e.g., tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF), zidovudine (AZT)] [15] .

Opravil et al studied 26 clinically stable, significantly pre-treated adults (median age 43 years; median CD4+ T cell count of 432 [IQR 378-540] cells/mm 3 ) who were switched in an uncontrolled, one-armed study from a failing (VL> than 400 copies/mL) cART regimen to 3TC monotherapy [32] . The proportion of patients reaching the clinical endpoint of a ! 30% decline in CD4+ T cell count or a CD4+ T cell count <200 cells/mm 3 at 24, 36, and 48 weeks was 36%, 57%, and 70%, respectively. When the investigators analyzed the participants stratified by the failing regimen at baseline (PI vs. reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-based cART (NNRTI or NRTI)), 81% of participants on PI-based cART vs. 40% of participants on RTI-based cART reached the clinical endpoint, despite similar baseline CD4+ T cell counts and other characteristics. The decline in absolute CD4+ T cell was not statistically different between the two groups, however, patients who were initially on PI-based cART had greater increases in the viral replication capacity, perhaps due to outgrowth of viral strains lacking PI resistance mutations detected on resistance testing in the absence of ART pressure. The authors concluded that 3TC monotherapy may be considered as a short-term strategy for \"selected\" patients failing RTI-based cART, but not PI-based regimens due to concern for increased viral fitness and greater likelihood of CD4+ T cell decline. Our study is unable to look at differences between PI vs. RTI-based cART as NNRTI-based regimens were excluded. Given the known lower barrier to resistance in NNRTI-based regimens and the possibility of rapid accumulation of resistance in the setting of continued nonadherence, we did not feel that it was ethical to randomize participants to continue NNRTI-based regimens in setting of continued nonadherence. During our study, participants in the continuing cART arm had declines in their viral loads, while those in the 3TC/FTC arm had increases in their viral loads, though the difference between arms was not statistically significant. It is possible that participation in a clinical trial with close monitoring, frequent interactions, and incentives may have resulted in greater adherence over the study period. Indeed fewer participants in both arms reported missed doses at the end of the study compared to baseline, suggesting that the frequent visits and/or other study interventions with the site's ongoing adherence work led to improvements in adherence even in these patients with a history of persistently poor adherence. Although there was no difference between the two arms in terms of adherence, it is possible that improved, though suboptimal adherence to a potentially more active regimen in the cART arm would result in better viral load responses [33] .",
