After birth it is difficult to supply calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) comparable to the high fetal accretion rate. It is not known whether high supplementation of minerals in the early postnatal period improves growth and bone mineralization. The aim of this study was to evaluate growth and bone mineralization at term corrected age (TCA) in very and extremely preterm infants who received different enteral Ca and P intakes during the first 10 days of life. Infants (n = 109) with birth weights below 1500 g were randomly assigned to one of three groups that differed in the nutritional protocols delivered until day 10: Group A, mother's own milk (MOM) and donor milk (unfortified); Group B, MOM (unfortified) and preterm formula; Group C, MOM (start fortification >50 mL/day) and preterm formula. Due to the earlier commencement of fortification, Group C received higher intakes of calcium and phosphorus and protein (p < 0.001) until day 10. At TCA weight, length, BMC and bone mineral density (BMD), measured by dual-X-ray absorptiometry, were not different between the groups. Nutritional intake of P was positively associated with length (\u03b2; (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.20 (0.001; 0.393); p-value = 0.048), whereas Ca intake was negatively associated with BMC (\u22121.94 (\u22122.78; \u22121.09); p-value < 0.001). A small interaction between Ca and P intake was only found for BMD (0.003 (0.00002; 0.00006); p-value = 0.036). The volume of human milk per kg provided during the first 10 days was positively associated with BMC (\u03b2; (95% CI): 0.013 (0.002; 0.023); p < 0.017). Higher intakes of Ca and P during the first 10 days, as provided in this study, did not improve bone mineralization at term corrected age.",

The number of days with parenteral nutrition and the time to achieve full enteral feeding were not different between the three groups. In agreement with the study protocol, Group C started HMF earlier, at a median (IQR) of day 6.0 (4.0-7.0) compared to Group A (day 11.5 (11.0-12.5)) and Group B (day 12.0 (11.0-13.5)) (p-value < 0.001). As a result of the study protocol, Group C received significantly higher mean (SD) intakes of both Ca (Group C: 21.5 (4.8) versus Group A: 15.7 (2.6) and Group B: 17.1 (4.0) mmol/kg per 10 days) and P (Group C: 21.6 (3.7) versus Group A: 16.5 (3.1) and Group B: 16.5 (3.0) mmol/kg per 10 days) during the first 10 days (p-value < 0.001). Furthermore, Group C received significantly higher mean (SD) intakes of protein (Group C: 32.1 (5.5) versus Group A: 26.8 (5.0) and Group B: 27.5 (4.3) g/kg per 10 days; p-value < 0.001) and carbohydrates (Group C: 114.5 versus Group A: 109.1 (10.7) and Group B: 103.6 (11.5) g/kg per 10 days; p-value = 0.02) According to the study protocol, Group A received a significantly higher percentage of human milk during the first 10 days, compared to Group B and Group C (p-value < 0.001), although these groups received predominantly human milk as well. The calorie intake differed only slightly between the groups. Table A2 presents the distribution of the route of supplementation of Ca and P. This table demonstrates that differences in mineral intake between the groups were based on enteral intake. Enteral: represents the day infants reached an enteral intake of either 120 or 150 mL/kg/day; HMF: human milk fortifier; Ca: calcium; P: phosphorus. All intakes are presented as the sum of the first 10 days; SD: standard deviation; med: median; IQR: inter quartile range. Missing data: Group A (n:2); Group B (n:4); Group C (n:4). Table 3 presents the anthropometric data at birth and TCA for all groups, including appropriate (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants. For both time points, weight and length were similar between the groups. All groups decreased in standard deviation score (SDS) for weight, as well as for length. The decrease in SDS for weight varied between \u22120.41 and \u22120.75, and for length between \u22120.33 and \u22120.69; for both measurements, there were no significant differences. Table 4 presents the data on body composition, as measured by DXA scan. A total of 35 scans were classified as acceptable. Not all infants were able to visit the outpatient clinic on the scheduled day and for logistic reasons, a number of infants were scanned close before discharge from hospital, therefore the gestational age and weight at the time of the scan varied. Nevertheless, the outcomes were similar across the groups for BMC and BMD with a wide interquartile range. Table 5 presents the results of the analyses evaluating the effect of being a member of one of the three supplementation groups, and the amount of human milk provided during the first 10 days, on growth and bone mineralization. Groups A and B were analyzed with Group C as the reference. Birth weight, gestational age at measurement and being small for gestational age were significant determinants for all outcomes and thus were used as covariates in all analyses. There was little evidence of an association between the studied groups and the outcomes of weight, length, BMC and BMD. The amount of human milk was associated with a significant effect on BMC, with each mL/kg increase in human milk over 10 days associated with an average increase of 0.013 g (p-value = 0.017) in BMC. Length and weight were not associated with intake of human milk. Table 7 presents the results of the regression analysis for the effects of Ca, P and protein intake per kilogram during the first 10 days on growth, and bone mineralization at term corrected age, of very preterm born infants. Based on the assumption that these three nutrients have a complex interrelationship in the effect on growth and bone mineralization, we analyzed the association with weight, length, BMC and BMD in three models by introducing step-by-step Ca, P and protein, thereby aiming to provide insight into-for example, how the effect of Ca might be influenced by the levels of P. In this analysis, the nutritional intakes of Ca, P and protein for the first 10 days were not associated with weight at term age. Phosphorus intake was positively associated with length, with a significant in increase of 0.19 cm (p-value = 0.047) length for each mmol/kg received over the first 10 days. This effect remained after inclusion of protein in the model. Calcium intake was associated with a significant negative effect on BMC. Our analysis showed that each mmol/kg of Ca received over the 10 days was associated with a decrease of 1.21 g of BMC (p-value: 0.001). The effect persisted and increased slightly with the introduction of phosphorus and protein in the model. The testing on the interaction of Ca and P over the 10 days intake was negative for all outcomes, except for BMD, which showed a small positive effect (\u03b2 0.0003 ; 95% CI (0.00002; 0.0006); p-value = 0.036). Group A and B were analyzed with Group C as the reference; The constant term in the models represents the expected value for Group C, for infants born appropriate for GA and who received the mean intake of nutrients. HM: human milk (mL/kg per 10 days); BW: birth weight (gram/kg per 10 days); GA at measurement: gestational age at measurement in weeks; Small for gestational age: below 10th percentile according to Fenton et al. [20] ; 95% CI: 95% confidence interval. BMC: bone mineral content (gram); BMD: bone mineral density (gram/cm 2 )-the nutritional variables reflect the intake of the first 10 days; Ca: calcium intake (mmol/kg per 10 days); P: phosphorus intake (mmol/kg per 10 days); protein intake: (gram/kg per 10 days); GA at measurement: gestational age at time of measurement; Small for GA: small for gestational age; all nutritional variables were adjusted for birth weight, GA at measurement and Small for GA.

In comparison, we could not demonstrate an association between P, Ca and protein intakes and weight in this study; nevertheless, we found that P and the amount of human milk were positively associated with study outcomes.

Calcium intake was associated with a significant negative effect on BMC and non-significant negative effects on all other outcomes, while phosphorus intake had a significant positive effect on length, and a non-significant positive effect on BMC. In general, the effect sizes were small, and BMD was the only outcome that indicated a positive interaction between Ca and P. Again, any interpretation should be performed with caution, since the results may be distorted by the small number of patients investigated with DXA scans. However, an explanation for this phenomenon may be that both minerals are closely related in the formation of bone and shortage of one item may influence the effect of the other mineral. Based on our previous study, we have strong indications that the supply of at least phosphorus was insufficient. For the same cohort of infants evaluated in this study, we reported changes in biochemical parameters for calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, in relation to nutritional intake [18] . Despite a high intake of P, serum P concentrations remained low in all three groups. It was demonstrated that serum P concentrations were significantly associated with amino acid intake, indicating that phosphorus was preferably used for cell metabolism instead of bone mineralization. Hypophosphatemia, in relation to high amino acid intake, has previously been reported in preterm infants and currently is recognized as 'Placental Incompletely Restored Feeding (PI-Refeeding) syndrome', caused by an imbalanced nutritional intake of amino acids and phosphorus [18, 48, 49] . Furthermore, we demonstrated that low gestational age was associated with higher renal excretion of phosphorus, irrespective of nutritional intake. Thus, considering the results of both studies, we speculate that, despite a high intake of minerals in Group C, a high cell metabolism and renal phosphorus wasting prevented adequate availability of phosphorus for adequate bone mineralization and consecutively prevented adequate use of calcium for bone mineralization.

Epidemiological studies have shown a high prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D concentrations in pregnant and lactating women, even in countries where adequate exposure to sunlight and sufficient dietary intakes may be expected [54, 55] . The foetus relies on maternal vitamin D stores, and thus postnatal vitamin D insufficiency may have impaired intestinal calcium absorption directly after birth. However, parenteral vitamin D supplementation was started directly after birth in all infants and enteral supplementation within the first week of life, following the recommendations for very low birth weight infants of the ESPGHAN 2010 [13] . Recently, it was demonstrated that doses of vitamin D, as provided in this study, led to sufficient vitamin D concentrations in very low birth weight infants, in the postnatal period, at 4 weeks of age [56] . The small differences in start day of enteral vitamin D supplementation between Groups A/B and C cannot explain the differences found between the groups. Furthermore, all infants received the same amount of parenteral intake, with relatively high amounts of minerals. Based on blood and urine analyses, it was permitted to provide extra parenteral mineral supplementation during the intervention period. The protocol for parenteral nutrition has been the standard of care at our department for many years and we felt it would be unethical to withhold the standard of care to high risk patients. There was room for a more individualized treatment in relation to enteral supplementation. This possibly has ameliorated the differences between the three groups and subsequently decreased the size of any effect of enteral supplementation. On the other hand, the study protocol reflected current generally accepted clinical practice, with a combined parenteral and enteral nutritional intake. We would like to note that none of our patients developed signs of rickets or fractures and that at follow up, around term age, our patients had achieved a median BMC comparable to 38-39 weeks gestation, according to Lapillone et al. [31] . Up to this date, most studies have been limited to the evaluation of enteral intake. We suggest that further improvements in the combined nutritional supply of parenteral and enteral intake in the early postnatal period are possible and that future trials should include both routes of administration, starting directly after birth. A limitation of our study was the fact that we were unable to include the intended number of patients. This may, on the one hand, have led to overestimation of observed effects; on the other hand, there is a chance of having missed certain effects. It should be noted that we only included three nutrients for the regression analysis, while enteral nutrition, especially human milk, is a complex emulsion and the composition and interactions between various factors that may have impacted on the digestion and absorption of nutrients were not included in the analysis and thus may have been missed.",
