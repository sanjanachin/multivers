These outcomes are believed to be due to alterations in the development of neural circuitry that supports emotion regulation. The specific neurodevelopmental changes that contribute to these difficulties are largely unknown. This study examined whether microstructural alterations in white matter pathways predicted long-term risk for internalizing problems in institutionally reared children. Data from 69 children were drawn from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized clinical trial of foster care for institutionally reared children. White matter was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) when children were between 8 and 10 years of age. Internalizing symptoms were assessed at the time of the MRI scan, and once children reached 12-14 years of age. Results indicated that neglect-associated alterations in the external capsule and corpus callosum partially explained links between institutional rearing status and internalizing symptoms in middle childhood and early adolescence. Findings shed light on neural mechanisms contributing to increased risk for emotional difficulties among children reared in adverse conditions and have implications for prevention and intervention.

Mean DTI values represented the average FA, MD, RD, or AD value across all voxels corresponding to each pre-defined white matter structure as defined by the JHU atlas. FA reflects the degree of restriction in the direction of water molecule diffusion and is elevated in tightly bundled, organized white matter tracts (Basser, 1995; Beaulieu, 2002; Sen and Basser, 2005) . While FA variability is highly sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter, FA is less sensitive to the type of change. For example lower FA could indicate white matter that is more diffusely organized, lower axonal density, or reductions in myelination. Measurements of MD are considered more useful for understanding the source of microstructural variability, as it can be decomposed into two eigenvalues (RD and AD) that reflect different properties of white matter microstructure (Schmithorst and Yuan, 2010) . RD represents the amount of diffusivity that occurs perpendicular to length of axons and is negatively associated with myelination levels. AD represents the amount of diffusivity that occurs in parallel to the length of axons, and increases with maturational changes in development, potentially reflecting increased organization and projection of axons. In this investigation, FA and MD values were examined for primary analyses. If significant associations between MD values and internalizing symptoms and institutional rearing were observed, on a post hoc basis, we explored whether these associations were due to variability in AD or RD values. Consistent with prior work (Howell et al., 2013) , we expected that RD values, but not AD values, would account for the associations between MD values, institutional rearing, and internalizing symptoms, as a reflection of potential maturational delays in early experience-driven myelination rates in institutionally reared children.",

In this follow-up study, we found that the integrity the body of the corpus callosum and the external capsule was associated with internalizing symptoms at 8 and 12 years of age. For both tracts, higher tract integrity predicted lower internalizing symptoms, with the external capsule more predictive of concurrently assessed symptoms, and the body of the corpus callosum more predictive of change in symptoms over time. Further, associations between MD of white matter tracts and internalizing symptoms were generally driven by RD values (considered more indicative of myelination levels) but not AD values (considered more indicative of axonal projection). This suggests that delays or abnormalities in myelination of critical white matter tracts may contribute to psychiatric risk. These associations are consistent with recent work suggesting that depression symptoms and related affective disorders may be driven by alterations in neural connectivity in critical pathways that subserve emotion processing and regulation (Liao et al., 2013) . Among these, poor connectivity between frontal and striatal regions have been associated with reductions in ''top down\" cognitive control over emotion and stress responses, altered responsiveness to rewarding input, and reduced motivation, which are characteristic of depression and anxiety disorders (Price and Drevets, 2010) . The external capsule, a white matter tract involved in fronto-striatal circuitry, contains a bundle of cholinergic white matter fibers that connects the forebrain to the cerebral cortex; neurons involved in this circuitry have been shown to be responsive to novel and motivationally relevant events (Selden et al., 1998) . Therefore, reduced integrity of the external capsule, as observed in institutionally reared children, may be associated with reduced motivation and behavioral withdrawal, and contribute to higher scores of depression. Our findings are consistent with additional studies showing associations between lower integrity of the external capsule and higher depression symptoms in youth and adult samples (Guo et al., 2012; Bessette et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2015) .",

In this study, we demonstrated links between reduced integrity of the body of the corpus callosum and depression and anxiety symptoms that were less likely to remit over time.
