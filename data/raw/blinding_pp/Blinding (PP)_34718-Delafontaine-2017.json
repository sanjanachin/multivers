        "text": "Background: The administration of an equimolar mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (N2O) is recommended during painful procedures. However, the evaluation of its use during physiotherapy after surgery has not been reported, although pain may hamper physiotherapy efficiency. This study investigated whether the use of N2O improves the efficacy of post-operative physiotherapy after multilevel surgery in patients with cerebral palsy. Method: It was a randomized 1:1, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. All patients had post-operative physiotherapy starting the day after surgery. Patients received either N2O or placebo gas during the rehabilitation sessions. All patients had post-operative pain management protocol, including pain medication as needed for acute pain. The primary objective was to reach angles of knee flexion of 110\u00b0combined with hip extension of 10\u00b0, with the patient lying prone, within six or less physiotherapy sessions. Secondary evaluation criteria were the number of sessions required to reach the targeted angles, the session-related pain intensity and the analgesics consumption for managing post-operative pain. Results: Sixty-four patients were enrolled. Targeted angles were achieved more often in the N2O group (23 of 32, 72%, vs. Placebo: 13/ of 32, 41%; p = 0.01). Conclusion: The administration of N2O during post-operative physiotherapy can help to achieve more quickly an improved range of motion, and, although not significant in our study, to alleviate the need for pain medication. Further studies evaluating the administration of N2O in various settings are warranted. Significance: During this randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, children receiving nitrous oxide and oxygen (N2O) achieved more often the targeted range of motion during physiotherapy sessions after multilevel surgery. Compared to placebo, nitrous oxide and oxygen (N2O) enabled a better management of acute pain related to physiotherapy procedures.",

FPS-R was chosen by three children in the placebo group (none in the N2O group). In three remaining cases for both placebo and N2O group, the patients could not perform self-assessment, due to their insufficient cognitive level. According to the French guidelines for pain assessment in children, we chose for these cases to perform a behavioural assessment using the VAS scale, which was performed by the physiotherapist (ANAES, 2000) . The decision to administrate the gas (either N2O or placebo according to randomization group) depended of the level of pain measured at the start of the session and during it ( Fig. 1 ). If the pain was low (<4/10 with VAS-, or <3rd face using FPS-R scale), no gas was administered. If the level of pain was higher, and if PCA was still in place, one or two boluses of morphine (25 lg/kg) were first administered within 20 min and, if effective, the session was conducted. If the pain was still high despite the morphine boluses, or in case PCA was no more in place, N2O or placebo gas was used. Most of the children were able to maintain the facial mask delivering gas; for quadriplegic patients, the mask was maintained by a nurse or one child's parent. Pain level was then assessed after 5 min after the end of gas inhalation. The physiotherapy session could start only if the pain was sufficiently decreased, i.e. lower than the reference value. If the pain intensity remained high, the session was postponed to the next day.",

N2O is an anti-NMDA agent; it acts similarly to ketamine, which participates in reducing the phenomena of central sensitization (Jevtovic et al., 1998; Kehlet and Dahl, 2003; Ramasubbu and Gupta, 2011) . These neurophysiological effects could explain that using N2O during our physiotherapy sessions reduced the associated pain during early post-operative mobilisations. Indeed, as the physiotherapy sessions were repeated, one could imagine that the patient's expectations of pain were lower in the N2O group. Conversely, negative patient expectations in the control group might increase the pain perceived during the following physiotherapy sessions. Pain decrease in the N2O group might also be explained by intercurrent neuropsychological processes such as patient's expectations and environmental conditions (Eccleston and Crombez, 1999) . Despite treatment with major analgesic agents, patients with negative expectations regarding their pain management will develop pain, and it was showed that their hippocampus is activated instead of cerebral areas usually recruited to decrease pain (Bingel et al., 2011) .

This greater efficacy might be related to a better pain management with N2O than with control, as pain associated with physiotherapy sessions was significantly lower among patients treated with N2O. In addition, although this difference did not reach a statistically significant level, analgesic consumption for the post-operative daily pain management had not the same profile between the two groups, as patients in the N2O group tended to take more level I and II analgesic agents, and less level III analgesic agents than patients in the control group.
