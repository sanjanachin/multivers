Purpose: To investigate the effect of a specialised content knowledge workshop on teaching behaviour, lesson context and student learning of BLS. Specialised content knowledge comprises knowledge of content progressions, skill analysis, and how to correct common errors. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial. Ten elementary teachers from three schools were assigned to a common content knowledge (n = 4) and specialized content knowledge condition (n = 6). Common content knowledge teachers received a 50-min BLS workshop focused on learning BLS. Next to learning BLS, specialised content knowledge teachers also practised the teaching of BLS focussing on skill progressions, skill analysis and how to correct common errors children would likely make. Teachers then taught one BLS lesson and their behaviour together with lesson context was collected through direct observation. BLS performance of 203 children (mean age: 11.3 years) was individually assessed immediately after the lesson. Results: Students taught by specialised content knowledge teachers spent more time practising BLS (57% vs 30%), were less engaged in cognitive activities (29% vs 55%) and achieved a significantly higher BLS performance (62% vs 57%) compared to students taught by common content knowledge teachers, P < .05. Specialised content knowledge teachers on average gave more feedback (31 vs 19). Discussion and conclusion: This study demonstrates that a 50-min workshop with a focus on specialised content knowledge impacted teachers' in-class behaviour, which in turn significantly improved students' BLS performance.",

It is often assumed that \"in order to teach BLS, one must be able to perform it well (i.e., common CK).\" Although the latter is probably true, it is arguably not sufficient to be an effective instructor. Research in the psychomotor domain has demonstrated that an increase in specialised CK substantially alters teachers' in-class behaviour in terms of task presentation (i.e., verbal behaviour and demonstrations) which significantly improves student learning. 15, 16 In this study we sought to investigate the effect of a specialised CK versus common CK professional development workshop for teachers. It is hypothesized that the BLS workshop focused on specialised CK will lead to improved teacher behaviour compared to a workshop focused on common CK. We also hypothesize that as a function of this improved teacher behaviour, student BLS performance will be higher. Since students are in classes in schools, we used a cluster randomized design.",

Therefore, teachers formed groups of three and rotated roles of teacher, doer, and helper. Similarly to the common CK group, the reciprocal peer learning instructional model was used during which teachers worked in pairs for 20 min with the assessor using the iPad followed by the 10 min peer assessment. Teachers were prompted to switch roles of teacher, doer, and helper every 5 min. In contrast to the common CK group, each dyad was taught BLS by a peer teacher through reciprocal peer learning with an iPad. The workshop leader explained and demonstrated critical features of the instructional model such as clearly defining roles of doer and helper, demonstrating effective behaviours of doers and helpers, and demonstrating effective teacher behaviour during student practice. In addition to the practice of this teacher behaviour along with learning the BLS content, teachers also learned how to recognize common errors their students are likely to make and how to correct these. For example, when you hear a hissing sound while performing rescue breaths, the rescuer is probably not putting his mouth correctly on the victim's mouth. As a teacher, you would then address the helper and ask him to reconsult the instruction of rescue breathings on the iPad and recheck the doer's performance. Teachers were trained to correct two common errors related to rescue breathings and two related to chest compressions.",

A professional development workshop as short as 60 min was able to affect teachers' behaviour, and in turn children's BLS performance. Instructor training and professional development focusing on specialised CK seems crucial for increasing effectiveness.",
