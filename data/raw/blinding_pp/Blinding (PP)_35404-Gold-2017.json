        "text": "Background: Acne vulgaris affects a diverse group of people, and there is an increasingly wide variety of acne treatments. Because of the many options, clinicians have a better ability to individualize treatment; however, achieving optimal results relies on understanding how various agents perform in specific population segments. Fixed-combination adapalene plus benzoyl peroxide (A/BPO) is a first-line recommended acne therapy and is available in two adapalene concentrations (0.1% and 0.3%) combined with BPO 2.5%. This analysis investigated whether gender and age have an impact on either the efficacy or safety of topical A/BPO 0.3%. Methods: A post-hoc subanalysis was performed on data from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallelgroup, 12-week study of A/BPO gel 0.3%/2.5% or vehicle gel in subjects \u2265 12 years old with moderate to severe acne vulgaris (Investigator global assessment [IGA] of 3 or 4). Efficacy measurements included achievement of an IGA of clear (0) or almost clear (1), and change in lesion counts from baseline to week 12. Safety measures included adverse events and cutaneous tolerability. The intent to treat (ITT) and safety populations were analyzed. Results: The A/BPO gel 0.3%/2.5% treatment group included 217 subjects. Among the subjects, 111 were 12-17 years old and 106 were \u2265 18 years old; 104 were male and 113 were female. A/BPO 0.3%/2.5% was safe, tolerable, and significantly superior to vehicle in success rates (IGA 0 or 1) and reduction of inflammatory/noninflammatory lesions (P\u22640.05) across both age groups and genders. Conclusions: A/BPO 0.3%/2.5% treatment achieved success and was equally effective and safe in younger vs older subjects and in males vs females. These results support the use of A/BPO 0.3%/2.5% in all subjects 12 and older. Clinicaltrials.gov registry: (NCT01880320)",

A phase II open-label pilot study of adapalene 0.3% and vehicle on the appearance of new scars showed that 24 weeks treatment with adapalene resulted in a 1 -2 grade improvement of global scar grade in 56% of patients. 28 A follow-up split-face study of A/BPO gel 0.3%/2.5% in subjects with moderate acne and facial atrophic scars showed that A/BPO gel 0.3%/2.5% stabilized total scar count at 6 months. In contrast, scars continued to form on the vehicle treated side, and by month 6 the difference in scar count change between A/BPO 0.3%/2.5% and vehicle was statistically significant (P = 0.036). 29 At the molecular level, adapalene down-regulates expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), beta defensing 4, and interleukin 18, and has been shown to increase CD1d expression, reducing overall inflammation. [30] [31] [32] In scarring, adapalene treatment was associated with enhanced collagen synthesis (collagen-3 and procollagen-1). 28 We have previously reported that the efficacy and safety of A/ BPO 0.1%/2.5% in adult females was comparable to that observed in adolescent females. 33 This analysis shows that the higher concentration A/BPO 0.3% is a good option for patients with moderate to severe acne (with a greater number of baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions than is generally seen in acne trials) of both genders and across the age spectrum. A/BPO gel 0.3%/2.5% was safe and well tolerated in all population sub-groups, with tolerability that was comparable to vehicle at week 12. Although the original study was not designed to compare A/BPO gel 0.3%/2.5% vs A/BPO gel 0.1%/2.5%, a treatment arm with A/BPO 0.1%/2.5% was included to provide a tolerability benchmark. As Stein Gold et al reported, the local tolerability profile of A/BPO gel 0.3%/2.5% in this study was similar to that of A/BPO gel 0.1%/2.5%. 16 With FIGURE 6.
