An estimate of mean weight gain was obtained from recent data on children between 5 and 7 months of age residing in the study area (i.e., 4.24 kg with a standard deviation of 1.014 kg) [26] . The trial sample size was computed using a two-sided independent t-test, with a significance level of 0.05, a power of 0.80, a standard deviation of 1.014 kg, a minimum detectable difference in weight gain of 0.2 kg, and taking into account an attrition rate of 20%. Based on the above specifications, a total of 1010 participants was calculated to be the sample size needed to declare that intervention groups would be different if, in fact, there would be a true between-group difference of 0.2 kg or more in weight gain between birth and 6 months of age. Sample size calculations were carried out using PS Power and Sample Size Calculations version 3.0 (Dupont and Plummer, 2009).

There are inconsistencies in study findings among published reports of trials of deworming in second and third trimester pregnant women where infant growth was an outcome measure. In a trial conducted in Uganda between 2003 and 2005, treatment with albendazole in the second and third trimester of pregnancy showed no benefit in terms of mean birthweight or the proportion of infants born with low birthweight [41] . In contrast, in a trial of single-dose mebendazole and daily elemental iron conducted in Peru, a beneficial effect on the proportion of infants born with very low birthweight (<1500 g) was observed [17] . In the present study, the prevalence (< 50%) and intensity of STH infection was low, and therefore closer to the baseline STH infection profile in the previous Uganda trial (68% prevalence) compared to the previous Peru trial (91% prevalence). A recent Cochrane review of published trials on deworming during the second and third trimester of pregnancy found no overall effect on maternal anemia, low birthweight, preterm birth, or perinatal mortality [42] . However, there was important heterogeneity in baseline STH infection and interventions (i.e., combination of anthelminthic drugs and micronutrient supplementation) among included trials that limits the appropriateness of pooling study results. Moreover, subgroup analyses restricted to those women infected with STH infections at baseline were not performed. The low STH prevalence in the current trial may account for the fact that an effect was not observed in the total study population (which included both infected and uninfected mothers), but that effects were demonstrated when the analyses were restricted to STH-infected mothers at baseline. Our study has several strengths. First is the minimization of measured and unmeasured confounding by external factors achieved through the RCT design. The sample size was large and recruitment of the study population was completed within a period of six months. A high follow-up rate was maintained throughout the trial, minimizing the potential for bias caused by differential loss to follow-up. In-depth training and standardization of anthropometric measurements ensured a high degree of accuracy and precision of outcome ascertainment, thus reducing the potential for measurement error. While deworming medication is readily available for purchase over-the-counter in the study area, compliance with the study protocol was high and non-differential between intervention groups. The consistency of our results between ITT, complete-case, and per-protocol analyses demonstrates the robustness of study findings.",

The limitations encountered in the conduct of this trial include a lower than anticipated baseline prevalence of STH (considerably lower than the 91% reported in from the same study area) [23] . This could be the reason why a benefit of deworming in the total study population was not detected, while ad hoc subgroup analyses in STH-infected women at baseline demonstrated a positive effect. Collecting stool specimens from women prior to enrolment was challenging and resulted in a less than optimal yield. WHO recommends use of the Kato-Katz technique on fresh stool specimens for the assessment of STH prevalence and intensity. However, due to ethical constraints, specimens collected from those participants randomized to the placebo group could not be immediately analyzed by this technique. The low number of available fresh stool specimens analyzed by the Kato-Katz technique may have affected the accuracy of STH parameter estimation at baseline. The storage of specimens until the end of the 6-month follow-up visit (i.e., > 1 year after collection) likely affected the integrity of specimens and the ability to detect parasites, especially hookworm eggs [43, 44] . Additionally, the direct smear and ethyl-ether concentration techniques have substantially lower test parameters compared to the Kato-Katz technique, and are unable to accurately assess the intensity of infection, thereby not allowing for the classification of morbidity thresholds established by WHO [40] . This likely resulted in some misclassification of baseline STH infection status, and likely also underestimated the effect of deworming in the analyses restricted to STH-positive women at baseline. Lastly, infant morbidity indicators were based on maternal reporting. We have no reason to believe that reporting differed by intervention group, although misclassification in morbidity status may have reduced the observed differences in morbidity outcomes between the two intervention groups.",
