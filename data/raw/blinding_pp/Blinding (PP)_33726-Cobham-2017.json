The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-session parent-focused intervention (Fear-less Triple P) in reducing children's anxiety symptomatology. The parents of 61 anxiety-disordered children (7e14 years) were randomly assigned to either the 6session parent-only group CBT intervention or a wait-list control (WL) group. Diagnostic and questionnaire measures were administered at post-treatment; as well as 3-, 6-and 12 months following the completion of treatment. Families in the WL group were reassessed after 6 weeks (the duration of the active intervention) and were then offered the intervention. The parent-only intervention produced superior outcomes for children on diagnostic and questionnaire measures. The percentages of children free of any anxiety diagnosis following the intervention were 38.7% (post-treatment); 58.6% (3-mth); 69.2% (6-mth); and 84% (12-mth). At the post-treatment assessment point, 3.4% of children in the WL group were free of any anxiety diagnosis. Mother and child questionnaire measures demonstrated gains from pre to post-treatment that were maintained over time. This proof of concept study suggests that the brief, parent-only intervention evaluated is an efficacious treatment approach for child anxiety disorders. A parent-only, group CBT intervention such as the one described here offers a cost-effective, low intensity alternative to traditional child-focused interventions.",

However, with more than 40% of participants not demonstrating significant improvement, there is considerable room for improvement. While addressing the issue of nonresponders is critical, it may not be the field's biggest problem. That title is arguably reserved for the issue of reach, given that the majority of anxiety-disordered children receive no treatment of any kind, evidence-based or otherwise (Essau, Conradt, & Petermann, 2002) .

Likely explanations for this enormous gap include the financial cost and the amount of time required to access treatment; and the social stigma associated with attending therapy (Jorm & Wright, 2007) . Stigma appears to be one of the most significant obstacles to help-seeking in parents of children who might benefit from a mental health intervention (Dempster, Wildman, & Keating, 2013; Reardon et al., 2017) . Importantly, in relation to help-seeking behaviours, parents view their children (as opposed to themselves) as both more likely to be stigmatized by others and more likely to be personally impacted by stigma (Dempster et al., 2013) . A recent systematic review also suggests that from the perspective of parents, access to mental health services is likely to be improved by the provision of more services, that are free, flexible, associated with reduced stigma and provide the opportunity for supportive relationships with professionals to be developed (Reardon et al., 2017) .",

        "text": "As noted, studies examining parent-only interventions have either involved a guided parent delivery approach (sometimes referred to as bibliotherapy), where the amount of therapist contact has been variable and a self-help resource has typically been the focus; or the face-to-face delivery of an intervention to parents in a clinic setting using programs that have varied in their degree of standardization. Rapee and colleagues (Rapee, Abbott, & Lyneham, 2006) were the first to evaluate bibliotherapy with parents of anxiety-disordered children, using the self-help book, Helping your Anxious Child (Rapee, Spence, Cobham, & Wignall, 2000) as the therapy resource. In this study, parents in the bibliotherapy condition had no contact with therapists. The bibliotherapy condition was found to confer some benefit for children compared to the wait list condition, however it was not as efficacious as the standard clinic-based treatment condition. The addition of therapist contact (in particular, therapist-initiated telephone contact) to the bibliotherapy format produced significantly better outcomes compared to those obtained with the bibliotherapy condition in the original study . In other bibliotherapy studies using a manualized parent \u00fe child intervention, families who worked through the program at home were found to achieve outcomes that were as good as those achieved with the same program delivered in the clinic (Cobham, 2012; Leong, Cobham, de Groot, & McDermott, 2009) . Most recently, Thirlwall et al. (2013) conducted a large study involving 196 anxiety-disordered children (7e12 years) and their parents. Two active treatment conditions (differing in the level of therapist support provided around the resource of a parenting self-help book) were compared with a wait list control. Parents in the active treatment conditions received either full guided parent-delivered CBT (weekly therapist contact over 8 weeks, consisting of four face-to-face sessionse1 h in duration e and four 20-min telephone calls) or brief guidance (fortnightly therapist contact over 8 weeks, consisting of two face-to-face sessions and two telephone calls). At the post-treatment assessment point, 50% of children in the full guided CBT condition were free of their primary diagnosis, compared to 39% in the brief guidance condition, and 25% in the wait list condition. At the 6-month follow-up assessment point, 76% of children in the full guided CBT condition and 71% of children in the brief guidance condition were free of their original primary diagnosis; with 53% and 55% of children in the respective conditions being free of any anxiety diagnosis. Importantly, in a recent long-term follow-up (3e5 years), in which 29% of the original sample participated, 79% of all children whose parents received either full or brief guided CBT were free of their original primary anxiety diagnosis, while 63% were free of any anxiety diagnosis (Brown et al., 2017) . The long-term maintenance of gains obtained with this low-intensity, parent-focused intervention is both extremely encouraging, and consistent with the long-term data obtained with more traditional CBT programs (Barrett, Duffy, Dadds, & Rapee, 2001 ; Saavedra, Silverman, Morgan-Lopez, & Kurtines, 2010). As the authors note, an important limitation of the study by Thirlwall and colleagues (and thus the follow-up study) centres on the fact that, in the original sample, families were excluded if a parent also met criteria for an anxiety or mood disorder (214 families were excluded on these grounds out of 552 referrals), as the intention was to deliberately select a sub-section of anxiety-disordered children who were likely to have a favourable prognosis in the context of a low-intensity, parent-only intervention.",

        "text": "To date, only a small number of studies have examined parentonly interventions delivered using the more traditional face-to-face modality, with many focusing on younger children. Mendlowitz et al. (1999) found that family-focused, child-focused and parentfocused interventions produced comparable outcomes on selfreport measures in anxious children aged 7e12 years. However, the small sample size (n \u00bc 62) and lack of follow-up beyond posttreatment make it difficult to draw clear conclusions from this study. and Cartwright-Hatton, McNally, White, and Verduyn (2005) reported substantial reductions in parents' reports of their children's internalizing scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) following a parenting skills program. Children in these two studies were aged 4e9 years and 2e5 years respectively. Noteworthy limitations in both Cartwright-Hatton studies include the small sample sizes (n \u00bc 11 and 43 respectively) and the lack of control groups. It is also important to note that inclusion in these studies was based on elevated Internalizing scores on the CBCL, not clinical diagnosis. Thienemann, Moore, and Tompkins (2006) reported significant reductions in the number of anxiety diagnoses met by 24 children aged 7e16 years following a parent-only intervention. Again, the small sample size and lack of any control group are important limitations. Two studies have compared a parent \u00fe child condition with a parent-only condition in the treatment of younger anxietydisordered children (Monga, Rosenbloom, Tanha, Owens, & Young, 2015; Waters, Ford, Wharton, & Cobham, 2009) . Waters et al. (2009) examined outcomes for 49 anxiety-disordered 4e8 year old children who were assigned to either a 10-session group parent-only CBT program or an intervention in which parents and children each received 10 sessions of group CBT. At post-treatment, 55.3% of children in the parent-only condition and 54.8% in the parent \u00fe child condition were free of their primary anxiety diagnosis (with both interventions being superior to the wait list control). Gains were maintained at 6-and 12-month follow-up. More recently, Monga et al. (2015) reported on outcomes for 77 anxiety disordered 5e7 year olds who were assigned to a 12-week intervention in which parents received group CBT and children simultaneously received either group CBT (parent \u00fe child CBT) or participated in a group involving stories, games and socialization with other children (parent-only CBT). Almost half (48.9%) of children in the parent \u00fe child CBT condition were free of their primary anxiety diagnosis at post-treatment, compared to 12.5% in the parent-only CBT condition. At the 6-and 12-month follow-up assessments, greater reductions in anxiety were found for children in the parent \u00fe child CBT condition relative to the parent-only condition, suggesting the importance of working with children as well as parents. Most recently, promising findings have been reported for older children using two different individually delivered, 10session parent-focused interventions (Lebowitz et al., 2014; Smith, Flannery-Schroeder, Gorman, & Cook, 2014) . In their open trial of the SPACE program, Lebowitz et al. (2014) designated 60% of their participants (n \u00bc 10) as responders based on the improvement scale of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI-I). It is especially noteworthy that participants in this trial were all families whose children had refused child-focused treatment. In their trial of a group parent CBT intervention with parents of 31 anxietydisordered children (7e13 years), Smith et al. 2014reported that children in the active treatment condition demonstrated better outcomes at post-treatment compared to children in the wait list condition in terms of clinician ratings of anxiety severity, parental ratings of interference, and number of anxiety diagnoses met. Gains were maintained at the 3-month assessment point. Both studies are limited by small sample sizes and limited post-treatment follow-up (post-treatment and 3-month follow-up respectively). In keeping with the pilot nature of this work, the methodologies used by these authors involved a waitlist control comparison (Smith et al., 2014) and a case series design (Lebowitz et al., 2014) .",

The parent and child versions of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS-C-IV-C/P (Silverman & Albano, 1996) ) were used to assess for caseness. The ADIS-IV-C/P demonstrates sound psychometric properties (Silverman, Saavedra, & Pina, 2001) , as well as good sensitivity to treatment effects. In order to be included in the trial, children had to meet criteria for a primary anxiety diagnosis with a Clinical Severity Rating (CSR) of 4 or greater out of 8. The same parent informant completed the ADIS-IV-C/P at each time point. Pre-treatment assessments with parents and children were completed at the Psychology Clinic, University of Queensland. Following treatment, all follow-up interviews were completed over the telephone. The telephone version of the ADIS-IV-C/P has been shown to have good inter-rater reliability (Cobham et al., 1998 ) and a high rate of agreement with the face-to-face format of the interview (Lyneham & Rapee, 2005) . Three postgraduate clinical psychology trainees conducted the pre-treatment diagnostic assessments and four different trainees who were blind to the study design conducted post and follow-up assessments. Interviewers came from a pool of clinical psychology trainees, all of whom had previous experience in administering both the child and parent versions of the ADIS-IV-C/P. Each interviewer had been trained using a mixture of video taped and live diagnostic interviews with parents and children. All trainees had to meet a reliability criterion of 85% in terms of the inter-rater reliability rating for both diagnoses and clinical severity ratings between the trainee and an expert diagnostician (the first author). All interviews were recorded and an independent interviewer from the same pool of trainees viewed a random twenty percent of interviews over the course of the study in order to ensure there was no interviewer drift. The inter-rater reliability was excellent (K \u00bc 0.98 for the primary diagnosis assigned).",

In relation to children's original primary diagnosis, 61.3% of children in the treatment condition were diagnosis-free at post-treatment, compared with 17.3% in the WL condition. In addition, the CSR of the primary diagnosis and the number of anxiety diagnoses met significantly reduced from pre to post for children in the treatment condition but not for WL children. The superior results demonstrated by the intervention evaluated in this trial are consistent with the diagnostic results reported by Smith et al. (2014) , although because these authors did not report on diagnostic remission rates, the only direct comparison possible relates to the number of anxiety diagnoses met. The results are also consistent with the diagnostic data reported by Thirlwall et al. (2013) . Based on maternal and child report on the SCAS and maternal report on the CBCL, children in the treatment condition demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms, compared to WL children who showed no change from pre to post. Paternal report indicated either no significant effect of time (SCAS e although it is interesting to note that fathers in the treatment condition reported on average, a 9-point reduction on the SCAS from pre-to post; whereas fathers in the WL group reported an average increase of over 4 points) or no time-by-group interaction (CBCL). The lack of intervention X time finding for fathers is interesting to consider given the low rate of engagement in treatment by fathers. Although the absence of fathers if reasonably typical in this field, it is essential to try and engage fathers more effectively. At follow-up, the percentage of children free of any anxiety diagnosis was 58.6% (3-month), 69.2% (6-month) and 84% (12-month).

Based on the Australian Psychological Society's (APS) Schedule of Recommended Fees for Psychological Services (2016e2017 (Psychological, 2016) ), the cost to a family of 16 individual, 1-h sessions of child-focused CBT is A$3856.00. The cost of participating in 6 group, 1.5-h sessions of the parent-only intervention described here is A$420.00 per family, just under 11% of the cost of a full course of individual, child-focused CBT. Given that both time and financial expense have been identified as barriers to treatment-seeking, a parent-only group CBT program may be a more accessible treatment option for families compared to traditional, child-focused CBT. Based on the data reported here, such a program appears to be a promising and inexpensive intervention in the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders.",
