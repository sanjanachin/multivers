Before the integration of any vaccine into childhood vaccination schedules, a lack of immune interference and acceptable safety when coadministered with other recommended vaccines should be demonstrated. Methods: This randomized, multi-center phase III trial was conducted in Mexico. Healthy toddlers (n = 732) received a booster dose of a licensed pentavalent combination vaccine [diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated polio vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP-IPV// Hib)] either concomitantly or sequentially, with the second dose of CYD-TDV administered as a 3-dose schedule. Antibody titers against diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and pertussis antigens were measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. Antibodies against poliovirus and dengue serotypes were measured using a plaque reduction neutralization test. Noninferiority was demonstrated for each of the DTaP-IPV//Hib antigens if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the difference in seroconversion rates between the 2 groups (CYD-TDV and placebo) was \u226510%. Safety of both vaccines was assessed. Results: Noninferiority in immune response was demonstrated for all DTaP-IPV//Hib antigens. After 3 doses of CYD-TDV, no difference was observed in the immune response for CYD-TDV between groups. There were no safety concerns during the study. Conclusion: Coadministration of the DTaP-IPV//Hib booster vaccine with CYD-TDV has no observed impact on the immunogenicity or safety profile of the DTaP-IPV//Hib booster vaccine. No difference was observed on the CYD-TDV profile when administered concomitantly or sequentially with the DTaP-IPV//Hib booster vaccine.",

Both vaccines were immunogenic and well tolerated when coadministered. Immunologic responses against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and H. influenzae antigens observed in the current study were within the range normally observed after administration of a booster dose of DTaP-IPV//Hib vaccine in toddlers, and its coadministration with CYD-TDV fulfilled the prospectively established noninferiority criteria. 15, 16 This is consistent with the absence of interference previously observed for the immunogenicity of DTaP-IPV//Hib after coadministration with a number of other vaccines routinely administered in infancy. 15 No difference was observed in the immunogenicity of CYD-TDV when it was administered concomitantly or sequentially with DTaP-IPV//Hib booster vaccine. GMTs reached after the third CYD-TDV dose were broadly consistent with those in other studies in young children conducted in Latin America. 17, 18 There were no safety concerns after coadministration of the second CYD-TDV dose with the DTaP-IPV//Hib booster vaccination. However, 3 episodes of febrile seizures were reported and these were considered by the sponsor as possibly related to study vaccinations. A postlicensure safety surveillance study has previously found seizures to be rare after administration of the DTaP-IPV//Hib vaccine. 19 The safety profile of the DTaP-IPV//Hib vaccine in the current study was broadly consistent with that observed in other phase III studies conducted in toddlers with a booster dose The seroprotection threshold for the diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, poliovirus (types 1, 2 and 3) and PRP was as follows: tetanus \u22650.1 IU/mL; diphtheria \u22650.1 IU/mL; poliovirus (types 1, 2 and 3) and PRP \u22651.0 \u00b5g/mL.

Although participants in group 2 received 3 doses of CYD-TDV, the schedule (0, 7 and 12 months) used in group 2 differed from the schedule (0, 6 and 12 months) used in group 1 and in phase III clinical trials. 4, 5 Nonetheless, the GMTs of the antibodies against dengue virus serotypes in the 2 study groups, 28 days after the second and third CYD-TDV doses, were similar. It should be noted that there is currently no established correlation between dengue antibody concentrations and clinical protection against dengue disease. 20 A recently completed phase III study, performed in children 2-14 years of age, found that vaccine efficacy tended to increase with age, probably reflecting increasing exposure to flavivirus/dengue with age. 5 Long-term surveillance data from the 3 efficacy studies conducted in 10 countries in Asia Pacific and Latin America showed a positive benefit-risk profile in children \u22659 years of age. For children who were under the age of 9 years, some benefit was observed in terms of vaccine efficacy against dengue; however, this age group showed a trend toward an increased risk of dengue disease requiring hospitalization. 6 Based on the data from these trials, CYD-TDV is currently licensed for use only in children 9 years of age or older. Should CYD-TDV be introduced during the early years of life in the future, coadministration with other routine vaccinations would be the most likely option to restrict the addition of further visits to existing vaccination schedules. Notably, a recent study did not identify any safety concerns after the concomitant administration of CYD-TDV and the licensed yellow fever vaccine to toddlers 12-13 months old in Colombia and Peru. 21 In conclusion, this study has shown that CYD-TDV can be coadministered with the DTaP-IPV//Hib booster vaccination without significant impact on immunogenicity or safety profile of the DTaP-IPV//Hib booster vaccine.
