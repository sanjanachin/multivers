Recent research estimates that indoor tanning can be linked to approximately 450,000 cases of skin cancer annually in the USA, Europe, and Australia. Despite these risks, indoor tanning remains popular with adolescents. This study tested the efficacy of a web-based skin cancer prevention intervention designed to reduce indoor tanning motivations in adolescent females. A nationally representative sample of 443 female teens was enrolled from an online panel into a two-arm, parallel group design, randomized controlled trial. Treatment participants received an appearance-focused intervention grounded in established health behavior change models. Controls viewed a teen alcohol prevention website. Outcome variables included willingness and intentions to indoor tan, willingness to sunless tan, and measures of indoor tanning attitudes and beliefs. The intervention decreased willingness and intentions to indoor tan and increased sunless tanning willingness relative to controls. We also examined indirect mechanisms of change through intervening variables (e.g., indoor tanning attitudes, norms, positive and negative expectancies) using the product of coefficient approach. The web-based intervention demonstrated efficacy in changing adolescent indoor tanning motivations and improving their orientation toward healthier alternatives. Results from the intervening variable analyses give guidance to future adolescent skin cancer prevention interventions. Keywords Melanoma prevention. Web-based intervention. Adolescents. Indoor tanning. National sample Melanoma is one of the most common cancers found in young women in the USA (National Cancer Institute 2015). Indoor tanning is an important melanoma risk factor, linked to approximately 450,000 cases of skin cancer annually in the USA, Europe, and Australia (Wehner et al. 2014). Youthful indoor tanning as few as ten sessions can increase melanoma risk by two to four times (Cust et al. 2011) with each additional tanning session adding another 2 % to the risk (Boniol et al. 2012). Consequently, reducing indoor tanning has emerged as a central goal in the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer (US Department of Health and Human Services 2014). Despite these significant risks, indoor tanning is still popular among high school and young adult females in the USA (Guy et al. 2011). Approximately one third of US female adolescents report either engagement or future interest in indoor tanning (Guy et al. 2015). Epidemiological data indicate that indoor tanning increases at 16 years old and then again at 18 years old as adolescents gain increasing mobility, finances, and freedom (Wehner et al. 2014). These trends are troubling given that early adoption of indoor tanning has been associated with increased odds of becoming a frequent habitual indoor tanner later in life (Baker et al. 2010).

The research team developed modules for each topic in the theoretical model. A professional digital marketing company, Marketing Strategies, Inc., converted each module into a website which was pretested with adolescents and then further refined using an interactive process involving the investigative team, the web development team, and adolescent tanner beta testers.

The results indicated that, after the intervention, treatment participants seemed more willing to try sunless tanning than control participants. Sunless tanning was presented as a reasonable alternative since it shares many of the advantages of indoor tanning (e.g., ease, does not require a change in fashion style, etc.) without the harmful UV radiation. Besides, many of the salons that teens use already offer sunless services. There is also some evidence that sunless tanning may serve as a transition from indoor tanning to ceasing tanning altogether (Mahoney et al. 2012; Quinn et al. 2015; Russo et al. 2012 ).",

Of these, changes in indoor tanning attitudes and perceived peer approval of indoor tanning demonstrated indirect mechanisms of change for the impact of the intervention on indoor tanning willingness and intentions.

(2013) focused on intervening with both parents and teens, In the \u03b2 Path column, the first row under each variable is intentions to indoor tan, followed by willingness EST = Sobel's + p < 0.10, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 which had positive effects on mothers' knowledge and teens' future intentions. While only a pilot study, this parent-based approach is promising. Aarestrup et al. (2014) , using a schoolbased approach and a health-oriented e-magazine, found reductions in teen behavior but not future motivations. The current results extend these findings by using a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the utility of a theoretically grounded appearance-focused approach in adolescents. The study does have several limitations that need to be considered. First, participants only came to the intervention because they were part of a study that directed them there. We do not know how it would be received or consumed in realworld settings. Additionally, the website which was a cutting edge when the study was initiated has now been supplanted by newer social media technologies which are more heavily utilized by adolescents. Also, the intervention only assessed the effects of one possible alternative, sunless tanning. Many other alternatives exist with the possibility that tailoring the alternative to the individual's primary goals of tanning will improve efficacy with some individuals. Lastly, this study focused exclusively on indoor tanning. Outdoor tanning could possibly be substituted for indoor tanning in these teens. Future work needs to broaden the focus to tanning and sun exposure in general.",
