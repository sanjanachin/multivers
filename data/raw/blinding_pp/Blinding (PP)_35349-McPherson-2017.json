Methods A parallel-group cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate whether a health intervention package, consisting of classroom-based health education, a hand-held health record and a health check, increased carer-reported health advocacy in adolescents with intellectual disabilities. Results Carers of 388 adolescents responded. Adolescents allocated to receive the health intervention package were significantly more likely to go to the doctor on their own, ask questions and explain their health problems to the doctor without help. Carers reported their adolescent had benefited, gaining increased knowledge and responsibility for their own health. They themselves reported an increase in knowledge and better ability to support the young person. Conclusions An educational initiative based on the Ask Health Diary led to improved healthcare autonomy for adolescents with intellectual disabilities.",

As a consequence, the followup rate for the intervention group was 60.0% compared with 72.9% for the control group. The difference in withdrawal rate between the two groups is likely to be due to intervention participants being contacted with regard to taking their adolescent for a health check, while there was little or no contact with the usual care group.

        "text": "A limitation of this study is that it is not possible to determine which intervention component is responsible for the increase in health advocacy. Health checks have been shown to consistently lead to substantial increases in health-promotion and disease-prevention activity when compared to usual care (Lennox et al. 2011) , but the authors have found no evidence in the literature that they result in any increase in autonomy for people with intellectual disability with regard to their health. The carers in this study reported that they thought the young person who had gone with them for the CHAP gained knowledge, increased confidence, improved ability to speak up for themselves at the doctor/doctors and more responsibility for their own health. As knowledge and communication are considered to be major components of self-advocacy (Test et al. 2005) , this would indicate the health check also had a role to play. The carers of the SEU students thought that the gains for their adolescents from having the health check were significantly greater than the SES carers did for their adolescents, including a greater awareness of previously undiagnosed conditions than their SES counterparts. Because young people attending SESs are more likely to have chronic conditions that require ongoing care and are more likely to be regularly seen by medical practitioners, it may be that undiagnosed conditions are less likely. Self-determination has been shown to be a predictor of successful transition to adult life (Malian & Nevin 2002) . Adolescence is a time when many young people are losing support from paediatric services. Many young people with special healthcare needs appear to make the transition to adult care successfully, but some experience serious gaps in outcomes (Bloom et al. 2012) . Bailey et al. (2003) suggest the promotion of autonomy via a well-planned transition programme will increase the likelihood that young adults with disabilities and/or their carers will be empowered to successfully negotiate the current mainstream healthcare system and will enhance the well-being of young adults with disabilities. Heller et al. (2011) recommends that since entering adult health care requires patients to self-advocate, set health goals and make decisions about treatment, transitionage youth with disabilities should be the target of health-related interventions to promote selfdetermination.",
