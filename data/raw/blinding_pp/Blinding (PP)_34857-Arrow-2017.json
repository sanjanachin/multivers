Methods: Children with ECC were randomized to test (atraumatic restorative treatment (ART)-based approach) or control (standard care approach) groups. Children aged 3 years or older completed a dental anxiety scale at baseline and follow up. Changes in child dental anxiety from baseline to follow up were tested using the chi-squared statistic, Wilcoxon rank sum test, McNemar's test and multinomial logistic regression. Results: Two hundred and fifty-four children were randomized (N = 127 test, N = 127 control). At baseline, 193 children completed the dental anxiety scale, 211 at follow up and 170 completed the scale on both occasions. Children who were anxious at baseline (11%) were no longer anxious at follow up, and 11% non-anxious children became anxious. Multinomial logistic regression found each increment in the number of visits increased the odds of worsening dental anxiety (odds ratio (OR), 2.2; P < 0.05), whereas each increment in the number of treatments lowered the odds of worsening anxiety (OR, 0.50; P = 0.05). Conclusions: The ART-based approach to managing ECC resulted in similar levels of dental anxiety to the standard treatment approach and provides a valuable alternative approach to the management of ECC in a primary dental care setting.",

A longitudinal study that assessed children aged between 9 and 12 years to determine the association between dental experience and changes in dental anxiety reported that children who did not receive invasive treatment were significantly more anxious than those who had. 10 However, for those children who attended regularly and received invasive treatment, their dental anxiety did not change significantly.

The ART-based care to managing ECC resulted in similar levels of dental anxiety to the standard treatment approach. An increasing number of treatments were found to have a preventive effect on worsening of dental anxiety whilst an increasing number of visits were more likely to worsen dental anxiety. The ARTbased care enabled more children to be provided with a greater amount of restorative care without adversely impacting on child dental anxiety and its use may have a mitigating effect on lowering the risk of worsening dental anxiety, thus providing a valuable alternative approach to the management of ECC in the primary dental care setting.",
