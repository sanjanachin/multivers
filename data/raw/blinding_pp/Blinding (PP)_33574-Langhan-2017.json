Staff may have intervened on patients differently depending on the patient information available to them (capnography vs clinical cues). As the information provided to staff at the onset of the study emphasized the difficulties in detecting hypopneic hypoventilation with clinical examination findings or pulse oximetry, staff may have been more vigilant in monitoring for abnormally low ETCO 2 values among their patients with capnography monitoring (hypopnea and apnea). In patients without capnography monitoring, a decline in respiratory rate (bradypnea) may have prompted interventions by staff. As the respiratory rates for patients with bradypnea were often within a normal range, staff may have been less concerned by elevated ETCO 2 values. However, as these are values that the staff in the control group could monitor over time, this may have prompted the interventions in this group accounting for the difference in rates. It appears that the staff interventions provided to patients in the intervention group were more effective at preventing future events from occurring. This may be due to the staff's ability to see immediate changes in the ETCO 2 values demonstrating that their intervention was efficacious. Similarly, interventions had less effect on subsequent rates of apnea than on the rates of hypoventilation. This may be indicative of the mechanisms of these events and potentially the need for more aggressive interventions for apnea. Overall, the number of interventions was low in both groups. Nurses were not mandated to intervene for all abnormal ETCO 2 values for this study. Several factors may influence a provider's impetus to perform an intervention. One of these is the threshold at which they feel the patient may be at risk of harm. While we chose our cutoffs for ETCO 2 based on the sedation literature in nonintubated patients, anesthesiologists and staff in the PACU may tolerate higher or lower values (18) . Furthermore, while one-on-one nursing is provided in the PACU, a patient's nurse is not necessarily at the bedside at all times.
