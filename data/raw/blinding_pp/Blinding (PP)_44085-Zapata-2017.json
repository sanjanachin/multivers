        "text": "Two common physical therapy (PT) practices for managing low back pain (LBP) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) include a supervised program of spinal stabilization exercises for 4 to 8 weeks and a 1-time treatment or instruction of spinal stabilization exercises with an unsupervised home exercise program (HEP). Supervised PT offers a mechanism to ensure proper exercise form and patient accountability, but regular PT visits can be costly and require time. A 1-time treatment may be cost-effective and less burdensome for the family. However, without regular PT visits, patients may not adhere to their treatment regimen and may incorrectly perform home exer-cises, including exercise form and dosage. Initial results of our short-term study indicated that 8 weeks of weekly supervised PT is more effective in reducing pain than 8 weeks of an unsupervised HEP in patients with LBP and AIS. 1 This 8-week study appears to be the first study investigating the effectiveness of supervised spinal stabilization exercises on pain reductions for adolescents with LBP and idiopathic scoliosis (IS). Previous studies have found that various conservative interventions were effective for treating LBP in adolescents without spinal deformity. [2] [3] [4] Although these studies included some variation of stabilization exercises, their interventions also included back education, 2, 3 general physical conditioning, 2, 4 and manual therapy. 2 More specific comparisons of the exercise interventions are difficult to make, because the descriptions (eg, intensity, duration, and specific types) of the exercise programs were not detailed, as noted in a recent meta-analysis. 5 Most of the studies evaluated the effects of exercises for managing LBP at the conclusion of the treatment. In 1 study, the effectiveness of the exercise program was examined in adolescents without spinal deformity at a 3-month follow-up, and results supported that exercises significantly decreased LBP. 3 No studies have evaluated the effects of exercises for managing LBP longer than 3 months in adolescents with IS. Furthermore, the long-term effects of exercises, specifically spinal stabilization exercises, in adolescents with IS and LBP have not been investigated, although evidence suggests long-term benefits of spinal stabilization exercises for adults with LBP. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 8 weeks of spinal stabilization exercises in adolescents with LBP and AIS at a 6-month follow-up. Supervised weekly PT was compared with 1-time treatment.",

These findings demonstrate carry-over effects of the 8-week supervised spinal stabilization exercises, which also implies that 8 weeks of supervised spinal stabilization exercises are more effective than 1-time treatment in reducing LBP and in increasing patients' overall perceived improvements over 6 months. Furthermore, a significant between-group difference in pain reduction (NPRS scores) was found between baseline and 8 weeks, but was not found between 8 weeks and 6 months. This finding indicates that the pain reduction effect after 8 weeks of supervised exercises was maintained over the next 4 months even after the treatment had been discontinued. Eight weeks may be an appropriate duration of treatment for managing LBP in AIS. Similar to the results or our study, Fanucchi et al 3 also found that exercises significantly reduced back pain intensity in patients with LBP without spinal deformity at a 3-month follow-up. Pain intensity reduction in our supervised PT group was 3.8 points, which is comparable to pain reduction of 3.2 points in Fanucchi et al's study. Both studies support the use of exercise for pain reduction for adolescents with LBP, with or without IS, although different types of exercise approaches were used.",

Therefore, our participants with AIS who received supervised PT for back pain made functional improvements more quickly than those who received unsupervised PT, although both groups reached similar functional levels at 6 months. We hypothesize the lack of group difference in the PSFS scores at the 6-month follow-up could be due to a limitation of the outcome measure itself.

We speculate that the OSW questionnaire may not be a useful outcome measure for assessing the degree of disability for AIS and LBP, because the OSW may not be specific enough and has not been validated for this patient population. Although we chose outcome measures based on a literature review and our clinical judgment, validation of outcome measures especially in younger adolescents is needed.

Specifically, a significantly higher number of participants in the unsupervised group were lost to follow-up at 8 weeks, 35% (n = 9) in the unsupervised group in comparison to 11% (n = 2) in the supervised group. We speculate that these participants discontinued the study because either they were frustrated with lack of progress or they were not compliant with exercises.

Given that we did not have a true control group, we are not certain whether or not the improvement over time was the natural progression of LBP in this patient population. However, almost all participants in our study had a long history of LBP, which suggests that their back pain may not have spontaneously improved over time.
