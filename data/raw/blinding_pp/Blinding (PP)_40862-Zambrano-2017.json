        "text": "Diarrhea is a leading contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Given the challenge of blinding most water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions, diarrheal disease outcome measures in WASH intervention trials are subject to potential bias and misclassification. Using the platform of a cluster-randomized controlled trial of a household-based drinking water filter in western province, Rwanda, we assessed the impact of the drinking water filter on enteric seroconversion in young children as a health outcome and examined the association between serologic responses and caregiver-reported diarrhea. Among the 2,179 children enrolled in the trial, 189 children 6-12 months of age were enrolled in a nested serology study. These children had their blood drawn at baseline and 6-12 months after the intervention was distributed. Multiplex serologic assays for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolytica, norovirus, Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae were performed. Despite imperfect uptake, receipt of the water filter was associated with a significant decrease in seroprevalence of IgG directed against Cryptosporidium parvum Cp17 and Cp23 (relative risk [RR]: 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.89). Serologic responses were positively associated with reported diarrhea in the previous 7 days for both Giardia intestinalis (RR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.04-3.63) and C. parvum (RR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.09-4.50). Serologic responses for all antigens generally increased in the follow-up round, rising sharply after 12 months of age. The water filter is associated with reduced serologic responses against C. parvum, a proxy for exposure and infection; therefore, serologic responses against protozoa may be a suitable health outcome measure for WASH trials among children with diarrhea.",

Another challenge in assessing water quality interventions is inconsistent intervention uptake. 50 Among children in intervention households, 23.6% were reported to have consumed some unfiltered water in the previous 24 hours; however, this study used an intention-to-treat analysis to conservatively assess health impact in light of expected imperfect uptake, and water quality characteristics were well balanced between study arms for both the children enrolled in this substudy (Table 1) and in the larger CRT, 25 enabling more direct attribution of the intervention effects to the water filter itself.",

This serologic study itself was exploratory and nested within a broader CRT, and therefore our study power for this particular nested study was limited by the logistical considerations of the larger CRT. Further complicating this, 36.5% of our baseline blood samples was lost due to quality issues, which we sought to address through multiple imputation methods to account for potential bias attributed to sample loss. In addition, the determination of firm cutoff points for seropositivity is inherently problematic, as some children may be misclassified as seropositive or seronegative on either side of the cutoff point. Cutoff points were assigned in this study using available data for C. parvum, Giardia, E. histolytica, and T. gondii antigens, whereas cutoffs points were assigned using mixture models for the antigens of the other enteropathogens examined in this study. Future studies may enable the establishment of firmer cutoff points, but in the meantime, analyses of dichotomized data should be supplemented with continuous analyses to avoid spurious associations. Although primary analyses involved only observed data, data were imputed for the purposes of comparison to correct for bias attributed to missing data in secondary analyses. Multiple imputation assumes that data are missing at random, but children who were lost to follow-up due to illness or caregiver refusals may differ from children who were lost to follow-up for other reasons. That said, caregiver refusals and childhood illnesses were rare at follow-up, and balanced between intervention and control groups when they occurred.",
