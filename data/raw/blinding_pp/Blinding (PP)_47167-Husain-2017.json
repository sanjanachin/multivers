        "text": "Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral misoprostol and Foley's catheter versus oral misoprostol alone for induction of labor. Methods: This open-label randomized controlled trial included 335 women requiring induction of labor. A total of 166 women were randomly allocated to induction with oral misoprostol alone and 169 women were assigned for induction with Foley's balloon catheter and oral misoprostol using a computer-generated allocation sequence. The primary outcome was rate of failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 h of induction. Results: The proportion of women failing to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 h in the combination group was lower (11.8% vs 28.7%, P = 0.001). When the two groups were stratified according to parity, the difference remained statistically significant only for parous women. The median induction-to-delivery interval (13.0 h vs 19 h, P = 0.000) and the median number of doses of misoprostol used (2 vs 3, P = 0.000) were lower in the combination group. The number of women who delivered vaginally in the combination group was significantly higher (91% vs 79%, P = 0.001). More neonates born to women in the misoprostol group had Apgar scores < 7 and were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (P = 0.016 and P = 0.007, respectively). Conclusion: The rate of failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 h was lower with Foley's balloon and oral misoprostol as compared to oral misoprostol alone.",

Another aspect is expectation from the method employed in terms of duration from induction to delivery. A few analyses evaluating a combination approach have been published. 14, [16] [17] [18] Most of these studies used the double-balloon catheter as it is licensed for labor induction, while Foley's catheter is inexpensive and readily available in all situations. All published evidence shows that there are no significant differences between the two catheters. 21 The results of Kehl et al. are similar to our study, showing no significant differences between the two, other than the cost. 18 Oral misoprostol is considered safer and allows more consistent administration of dose as compared to the vaginal route. The oral route has additional benefit of user acceptance. 6 We used oral misoprostol to ensure that doses are adequately administered. Our results are in agreement with other studies. 17 The total number of doses required for inducing delivery decrease when an additional method of induction is used; this culminates in decreased incidence of complications (such as hyperstimulation and decreased Apgar scores at birth). The combination group required one dose less (two vs three) in our study. Further, fewer neonates in the combination group had Apgar scores <7 and fewer were admitted to the NICU in the combination group. This difference remained significant in the parous group but not in the nulliparous group.",
