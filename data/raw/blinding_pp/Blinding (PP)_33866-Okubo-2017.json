Objective: This trial was conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of the SQ HDM SLIT tablet in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe HDM-induced allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods: The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial including 946 Japanese adults and adolescents (12-64 years). Subjects were randomly assigned to daily treatment with the SQ HDM SLIT tablet at a dose of 10,000 Japanese allergy units (JAU) or 20,000 JAU or to placebo (1:1:1). The primary end point was the total combined rhinitis score (TCRS), which is composed of AR symptom and medication scores during the efficacy evaluation period. Symptom and medication scores of AR and conjunctivitis, rhinitis quality of life, and symptom-free and symptom-severe days were evaluated as secondary end points. Results: Analysis of the primary end point demonstrated statistically significant reductions in TCRSs of 1.15 (22%, P <.001) in the 10,000-JAU group and 0.99 (19%, P <.001) in the 20,000-JAU group compared with the placebo group. The statistically significant treatment effect was evident from 12 weeks of treatment onward. All secondary end points, except AR medication score, were statistically significant in favor of active treatment compared with placebo. Post hoc analysis of TCRSs in adolescents showed the same efficacy as in adults (P <.05). The treatment was well tolerated by both adults and adolescents. Conclusion: The trial confirmed the efficacy and safety profile of the SQ HDM SLIT tablet in Japanese adult and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe HDM-induced AR. These data support the robust efficacy and safety profile of previously reported European data.",

        "text": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II/III trial is the first trial with the SQ HDM SLIT tablet in a Japanese population. The trial revealed a statistically significant reduction in TCRSs for both active doses of the SQ HDM SLIT tablet compared with placebo in a population of Japanese adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe HDM-induced AR. The reduction in TCRSs compared with the placebo group (1.15 for the selected dose of 10,000 JAU) was similar in magnitude to what was recently observed with the SQ HDM SLIT tablet in an adult European population with moderate-to-severe HDM-induced AR (1.18 for 6 SQ-HDM/10,000 JAU). 15 In the trial by Demoly et al, 15 the reduction in TCRSs induced by the SQ HDM SLIT tablet was equally driven by reductions in AR medication score and symptom score, whereas in the current trial the TCRS reduction was almost exclusively driven by a reduction in AR symptoms. This difference might reflect the slightly different populations in the 2 trials. The subjects in the European trial had moderate-to-severe AR, despite frequent use of allergy pharmacotherapy, which is in contrast to the current trial, in which Japanese subjects had a very low habitual use of allergy pharmacotherapy. The results of the current trial are, despite differences in scoring scales, comparable with what was shown in a trial with a different HDM SLIT tablet in a similar population with low use of allergy pharmacotherapy. 23 To date, there is no general consensus regarding the optimal methodology to set the minimum clinical important difference specific for TCRSs in AIT trials in patients with perennial AR. Therefore the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency has decided not to provide fixed values for the definition of a clinically relevant difference in the primary end point between the active and control populations but rather to ask the investigator to predefine and justify their specific approach handling end points. In the trial by Demoly et al, 15 a minimum clinical important difference was predefined as the absolute difference in adjusted mean TCRS between the active and placebo groups, being 1. 15 In the present trial the absolute differences met this definition. The World Allergy Organization has suggested a minimum clinically relevant effect for immunotherapy in general as being a 20% or greater relative difference to placebo. 24 In the current trial the relative differences in TCRSs from the placebo group were 22% and 19% in the 10,000-and 20,000-JAU groups and 21% in the total active subjects. The results of the primary end point assessments also met the US Food and Drug Administration-established efficacy criteria for SLIT products as a relative difference of 15% or greater in the efficacy end point compared with placebo and a 95% CI upper limit of 10% or greater. 25, 26 The clinical relevance of the observed results is further supported by a significant improvement in JRQLQ scores for both active groups compared with the placebo group and also by an increased number of days with no rhinitis/conjunctivitis symptoms, as well as a reduced number of days with severe symptoms (details on the symptom relief evaluation and JRQLQ are available in the Results section and Tables E5 and E6 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).",
