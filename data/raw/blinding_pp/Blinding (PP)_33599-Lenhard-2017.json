Design Single-blinded randomised controlled trial. Setting A research clinic within the regular child and adolescent mental health service in Stockholm, Sweden. Participants Sixty-seven adolescents (12-17 years) with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition diagnosis of OCD. Interventions Either a 12-week, therapist-guided ICBT intervention or a wait list condition of equal duration. Primary outcome measures Cost data were collected at baseline and after treatment, including healthcare use, supportive resources, prescription drugs, prescriptionfree drugs, school absence and productivity loss, as well as the cost of ICBT. Health outcomes were defined as treatment responder rate and quality-adjusted life years gain. Bootstrapped mixed model analyses were conducted comparing incremental costs and health outcomes between the groups from the societal and healthcare perspectives. Results Compared with waitlist control, ICBT generated substantial societal cost savings averaging US$\u2212144.98 (95% CI \u2212159.79 to-130.16) per patient. The cost reductions were mainly driven by reduced healthcare use in the ICBT group. From the societal perspective, the probability of ICBT being cost saving compared with waitlist control was approximately 60%. From the healthcare perspective, the cost per additional responder to ICBT compared with waitlist control was approximately US$78. Conclusions The results suggest that therapist-guided ICBT is a cost-effective treatment and results in societal cost savings, compared with patients who do not receive evidence-based treatment. Since, at present, most patients with OCD do not have access to evidence-based treatments, the results have important implications for the increasingly strained national and healthcare budgets. Future studies should compare the cost-effectiveness of ICBT with regular face-to-face CBT. Trial registration number NCT02191631. IntroductIon Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts or urges (obsessions), coupled in most cases with excessive and ritualistic behaviours (compulsions). 1 OCD has a prevalence between 0.25% to 2% in the child and adolescent population 2 3 and is associated with substantial reductions in health-related quality of life, 4 5 as well as impairments in education, social relations and family functioning. 6 The societal cost of OCD in adults in the USA is estimated to 10.6 billion US$ per year. 7 International guidelines, such as those published by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 8 and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 9 recommend cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment for young people with OCD.
