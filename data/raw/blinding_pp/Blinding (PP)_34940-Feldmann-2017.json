Materials and Methods: Fifty-four patients (28 girls and 26 boys) with a mean age of 9.8 years (SD 1.28 years) were randomized into two groups. Group A received a conventional hyrax appliance and group B a hybrid hyrax appliance anchored on mini-implants in the anterior palate. Questionnaires were used to assess pain intensity, discomfort, analgesic consumption, and jaw function impairment on the first and fourth days after RME appliance insertion. Results: Fifty patients answered both questionnaires. Overall median pain on the first day in treatment was 13.0 (range 0-82) and 3.5 (0-78) for groups A and B, respectively, with no significant differences in pain, discomfort, analgesic consumption, or functional jaw impairment between groups. Overall median pain on the fourth day was 9.0 (0-90) and 2.0 (0-71) for groups A and B, respectively, with no significant differences between groups. There were also no significant differences in pain levels within group A, while group B scored significantly lower concerning pain from molars and incisors and tensions from the jaw on day 4 than on the first day in treatment. There was a significant positive correlation between age and pain and discomfort on the fourth day in treatment. No correlations were found between sex and pain and discomfort, analgesic consumption, and jaw function impairment. Conclusions: Both tooth-borne and tooth-bone-borne RME were generally well tolerated by the patients during the first week of treatment.",

        "text": "Rapid maxillary expansion (RME) is a common procedure in young children with a constricted maxilla and transverse discrepancies between the maxilla and the mandible. 1, 2 The primary goal of RME is to maximize dentofacial orthopedics and minimize ortho-dontic movement, but a recently published systematic review 3 indicates that the skeletal effects (ie, the opening of the midpalatal suture) account for only approximately 20%-50% of the total screw expansion, meaning that the dentoalveolar effects in terms of molar tipping and alveolar bending account for over 50% of the total effect. To minimize these dental side effects, which likely increase the risk of relapse, skeletally anchored RME appliances have been introduced. [4] [5] [6] Pain and discomfort are well-known side effects of orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances, [7] [8] [9] but few studies [10] [11] [12] have explored pain and discomfort during RME treatment. These few studies have concluded that most children undergoing RME report pain, which generally occurs during the initial phase and diminishes thereafter. The highest pain levels were reported during the first 10 activations and peaked on days 3 and 4. Activation protocols with two turns/d result in greater pain levels than do protocols with only one turn/ d. 11, 13 With the introduction of skeletally anchored RME appliances, the question arises of how patients experience this new design, considering that they are mostly quite young. Earlier studies 14, 15 indicate that adolescent patients have very good tolerance of the insertion of mini-implant anchors both interradicularly and in the palate. These studies also concluded that age was not a predictor of pain and discomfort. To our knowledge, however, no studies have explored pain intensity and discomfort during treatment with skeletally anchored RME appliances.",
