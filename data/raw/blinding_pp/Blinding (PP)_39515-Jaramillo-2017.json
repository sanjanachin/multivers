In the main trial, Ugandan children 6-59 months with smearconfirmed malaria and iron deficiency [zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP > = 80 \u03bcmol/mol heme)] were treated for malaria and randomized to start a 27-day course of oral iron concurrently with (immediate group) or 28 days after (delayed group) antimalarial treatment. All children were followed for the same 56-day period starting at the time of antimalarial treatment (Day 0) and underwent passive and active surveillance for malaria and other morbidity for the entire follow-up period. All ill children were examined and treated by the study physician. In this secondary analysis of morbidity data from the main trial, we report that although the incidence of malaria-specific visits did not differ between the groups, children in the immediate group had a higher incidence rate ratio of all-cause sick-child visits to the clinic during the follow-up period (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) immediate/delayed = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.05-3.03, p = 0.033). Although these findings need to be tested in a larger trial powered for malaria-specific morbidity, these preliminary results suggest that delaying iron by 28 days in children with coexisting malaria and iron deficiency is associated with a reduced risk of subsequent all-cause illness.",

We also did not find a significant difference between the groups in malaria-specific morbidity, although our study was not powered for this outcome. Similar to a recent study of iron-fortified micronutrient sprinkles in Pakistan, we did find iron to be linked with an increased risk of illnesses other than malaria, including respiratory illness [14] . It is unclear why the incidence of all-cause sick-child visits was greater in our study's immediate group. Perhaps lower absorption of iron at the time of supplementation, which we observed in the immediate iron group [8] , translated into more unabsorbed iron in the gut. Unabsorbed iron may shift the gut microbiome in favor of enteropathogenic bacteria, rather than beneficial barrier bifidobacteria [15] . Such a pathogenic shift with iron was observed in Kenyan children receiving iron-fortified food products [15] [16] and was associated with more frequent diarrheal illness. Associations between pathogenic shifts in the gut microbiome and exacerbation of respiratory infections have also been described [17] [18] .",
