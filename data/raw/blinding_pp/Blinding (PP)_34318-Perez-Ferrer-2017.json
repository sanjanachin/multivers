        "text": "The aim of this study is to test whether the addition of a low-dose of antibiotic (vancomycin) to the wash solution (saline) of the cell-saver reduces the incidence of bacterial contamination of the autologous red blood cell (RBCs) concentrate recovered. Material and method: Experimental, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study performed on 20 consecutive patients scheduled for posterior spinal fusion surgery. Intraoperative bleeding was processed through a cell-saver: HaemoLite \u00ae 2+, in which the RBCs were washed according to randomization group, with saline (control group) or saline + 10 g ml \u22121 vancomycin (vanco group). Data regarding age, weight, processed and recovered volume, blood count, blood culture, and vancomycin concentration in RBCs concentrates obtained and incidence of fever after reinfusion were collected. Results: Processed volume was 843 \u00b1 403 ml and recovered volume 121 \u00b1 29 ml, with haemoglobin concentration 10.4 \u00b1 5.0 g dl \u22121 and haematocrit 29.1 \u00b1 15.9% (mean \u00b1 SD). Recovered RBC concentrate cultures were positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 5 cases (50%) of the control group while all cultures were negative in the vanco group (p = 0.016). The difference between the theoretical concentration of vancomycin administered and the concentration determined in the recovered RBC concentrate was 1.31 g ml \u22121 (95% CI 1.19-1.43; p = 0.074). Conclusions: The addition of vancomycin at a concentration of 10 g ml \u22121 to the wash solution of the cell-saver achieved similar concentrations in the autologous blood concentrate recovered allowing for bacterial removal, with negative blood cultures in all cases.",

Several authors have tested different methods of eliminating, or at least reducing, the level of contamination, and several studies have set out to determine the cut off point for acceptable bacterial levels in such blood, or the effectiveness of different methods of eliminating these bacteria. Antibiotic prophylaxis with cefuroxime does not prevent contamination of salvaged blood, 7 and evidence has shown that washing with saline does not eliminate bacteria, 17 although it does reduce their concentration. 18 Leucocyte filters are thought to eliminate bacteria by a process of adhesion. Although this would improve the quality of salvaged blood by removing a large number of bacteria, not all are eliminated. 15,17---19 Furthermore, the removal of leukocytes for this purpose might not be the best approach, since studies in donated blood have shown that these cells are able to reduce some species of contaminating bacteria after a number of hours. 20 No studies have so far explored the use of antibiotics to reduce contamination of salvaged blood, instead of limiting their use to intravenous pre-surgical prophylaxis. 7 However, it stands to reason that achieving similar antibiotic levels in salvaged blood to those present in peripheral blood following oral or intravenous administration, would remove contaminating bacteria from autologous blood. This has been shown to be the case in our study. We needed to administer the antibiotic in such a way as to achieve predictable, controlled levels in salvaged blood. If the antibiotic is added to the reservoir, as was done in some earlier cases, dilution with heparinised saline and subsequent washing with SS considerably reduces drug levels, making it impossible to control dosage. However, we have observed that adding the target volume of antibiotic to the wash solution allowed us to control the drug levels present in salvaged blood. The scant differences observed between vanco [T] and vanco [S] may be due to the method used to obtain the drug concentration to be mixed with the wash solution. This was achieved by 2 successive dilutions in a very small volume (10 ml), as described in the material and methods section. We speculate that a single dilution in a larger volume (500 mg vancomycin in 500 ml of SS) would have allowed us to adjust the level more accurately and to bring vanco [R] levels even closer to those of vanco [S] . Another factor that may have played a role in the difference between theoretical and actual concentrations is the accuracy of the method used to determine vancomycin levels. This, according to the manufacturer's technical specifications, has an overall standard deviation of 0.32 and a coefficient of variation of 4.26%.",
