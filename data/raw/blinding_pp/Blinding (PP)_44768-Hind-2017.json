The prevention of joint contractures is a multidisciplinary effort, involving specialist hubs and community spokes. 32 Regional consultant neurologists and specialist neuromuscular physiotherapists review disease progress and treatment regimens at clinic visits, typically twice a year, and offer management suggestions to community physiotherapists. 28 While a boy is still able to walk, a community paediatric physiotherapist will monitor him for hip and ankle contractures until he becomes wheelchair dependent. 33 The community physiotherapist is responsible for tailoring a programme of stretches and exercises to the boy's individual needs and tolerance levels, 28 and for training parents, carers, school staff or, occasionally, other health and social care staff to deliver the stretches. 33 Management should consist of a variety of treatment options aimed at maintaining the length and extensibility of affected muscle groups. 34 Although evidence to support interventions aimed at improving the range of movement is lacking, there are generally recognised principles that should be carried out to delay or, where possible, prevent the development of contractures. 35 These include the prescription of a regular targeted stretching regime and the use of specific orthotics (e.g. resting or night splints are generally recommended). Stretches are typically prescribed to be performed at home, in school or occasionally in community clinics, on a minimum of 4-6 days per week. They are intended to maintain dorsiflexion and hip flexion range, among other targets, with a view to postponing the onset of contractures and prolonging the length of time the child can walk independently. 33 There are no clear guidelines to specific exercise prescription, but regular submaximal exercise is recommended to maintain existing muscle strength and avoid secondary disuse atrophy, 36, 37 along with general advice on regular activity such as walking, cycling and swimming. Although there is still the need for further research, there is general agreement that exercise that contains a substantial eccentric component (such as trampolining, stair descending) should be avoided because of the risk of exacerbating muscle damage. 38 Physiotherapy plays its part in the holistic, multidisciplinary management of children with DMD, providing specialist assessment, physiotherapy prescription and ongoing monitoring and evaluation of a complex and progressive condition. 28 Liaison with other specialist services, such as orthotics, wheelchair services, social and housing services, and schools to ensure the provision of appropriate equipment and support in a timely manner to maximise function and independence wherever possible is key.

A programme theory recognises that, around the AT exercises, there is a complex series of contracts, actions, interactions and emergent relationships between people and organisational units. For many researchers, the purpose of evaluating a programme is to develop or test a theory about how it works, rather than merely evaluating whether it works. 83 If the programme is successful, then the evaluation can identify essential elements for replication; if the programme is unsuccessful, then it can identify whether or not this was through failures of implementation, translation to unsuitable contexts or treatment theory. 84 A programme theory, then, is broader than a treatment theory; it focuses on assumptions about background behavioural, social and economic mechanisms that operate if the treatment is to be delivered as scheduled. Programme theory was developed iteratively: (1) deductively, through a review of the literature, (2) by articulating mental models, through discussions at stakeholder meetings, and (3) inductively through interviews with participants and professionals. We searched the literature to inform an initial thematic framework about how children with neurological or musculoskeletal problems, their parents and physiotherapists respond to physical therapy programmes.

Normally, community physiotherapists see families between once every 6 weeks and once every 6 months to give an exercise prescription (the minority of patients that are at special schools have therapists who come into school to deliver exercises two or three times per week). Specialist physiotherapists on the team felt that the delivery of LBT would be variable between participants in between seeing community physiotherapists. In routine practice, specialist physiotherapists can recommend problems to work on and specific techniques to community physiotherapists, but varying degrees of co-operation between specialist and community physiotherapists were reported. The reorganisation of services in 2013, when this research was commissioned, following the Health and Social Care Act 2012, 187 resulted in complexity and a lack of uniformity of services previously hosted by primary care trusts, including community physiotherapy. 188 As we anticipated difficulties finding out with whom to engage and approach, in order to gain the appropriate NHS Research and Development permissions to implement the study, we asked physiotherapists at participating specialist centres to prescribe LBT for the duration of the trial (minutes, TMG, 15 September 2015). We then relied on parents to capture the weekly delivery of LBT on a log.",
