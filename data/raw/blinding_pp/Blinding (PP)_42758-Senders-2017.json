With the increased usage of a twodose varicella vaccine (as recommended by the ACIP), approval of other VZV-containing products and the adoption of varicella vaccination in additional countries, the demand for VZV-containing vaccines has increased. This study (NCT02062502) evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of VARIVAX TM (VAR, varicella vaccine live) manufactured using a new seed manufacturing process (VAR NSP) compared to the currently licensed VAR. Healthy children 12-23 months were randomized (1:1) into Group 1 (2 doses of VAR NSP given concomitantly with MM -R TM II, \u00bb3 months apart) versus Group 2 (2 doses of VAR given concomitantly with MM -R TM II, \u00bb3 months apart). Serum samples collected prior to vaccination on Day 1 and 6 weeks Postdose 1 were tested for antibody to VZV using a glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). Safety was assessed Days 1 to 42 following each vaccination. Six weeks Postdose 1, the response rate (percent of subjects with VZV antibody titer 5 gpELISA units/ mL) of VAR NSP was non-inferior compared to VAR. Vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) were comparable with the exception of measles-like rash, where a greater number of rashes were observed with VAR than VAR NSP. The 2 vaccination groups were comparable with incidence rates of AEs, injection-site AEs, vaccine-related AEs, systemic AEs, and serious AEs.

        "text": "Varicella is a generalized illness that has an incubation period of about 12 to 16 days, is highly contagious, and is characterized by a papulovesicular rash that typically resolves in 5 to 6 days. 1 Complications of varicella include secondary bacterial infection, encephalitis, and pneumonia. Less common complications include nephritis, arthritis, orchitis, uveitis, thrombocytopenia, purpura fulminans, Reye's syndrome, and death. Although immunity following varicella infection is generally long-lasting, the virus may persist in latent form in the peripheral nerve tissue (ganglia). As a result of immune senescence due to advanced age, stress, and/or immunocompromising conditions, herpes zoster (or shingles) may develop as a result of the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV). 2, 3 Before the introduction of a varicella vaccine (VARIVAX TM ; Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA), an estimated 4 million cases of varicella occurred annually in the US, 4 resulting in 10,000 yearly hospitalizations and over 100 deaths. [4] [5] [6] VARIVAX TM was licensed in 1995 on the basis of studies that demonstrated singledose efficacy of 70% to 95% against clinical disease and 95% against severe disease over a 7-to 10-year follow-up period. 7 Following licensure, vaccine coverage has increased to an estimated 90% of the pediatric population in the US, 8, 9 reducing varicella incidence by up to 91%, 8 and varicella-related hospitalizations by 75% to 88%. 10, 11 During the first 12 years following licensure of VARIVAX TM in the US, varicella-related mortality was reduced by 88%, including a 97% reduction in individuals under 20 years of age and a 96% reduction in individuals under 50 years of age. 12 Recent epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that VAR-IVAX TM affords long-term protection against varicella, and also imparts herd immunity to unvaccinated individuals in settings where vaccine adoption is widespread. [13] [14] [15] Following the recommendation of a two-dose varicella vaccination schedule by the ACIP, 11 the approval of other VZV-containing products (ZOSTAVAX TM and ProQuad TM ; Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA), 16, 17 and the adoption of varicella vaccination in additional countries worldwide, the demand for vaccines containing VZV has increased.

The primary safety endpoints were: fever (temperature 102.2 F [39.0 C] oral equivalent) from Days 1 to 42 after each vaccination; varicella-like, zoster-like, measles-like or rubella-like rashes, or mumps-like symptoms occurring from Days 1 to 42 following each vaccination; and solicited injection-site reactions (redness, swelling, pain/tenderness) of any intensity or size from Days 1 to 5 following each vaccination. Parents/guardians recorded daily axillary temperatures and any injection-site or systemic adverse events (AEs) using a (VRC). 26 Subjects were followed for 42 days following each vaccination visit for unsolicited injection-site and systemic AEs. All subjects were followed for serious AEs (SAEs) from the time of enrollment into the study through 180 days Postdose 2. During the phone call on Day 271 (Day 180 Postdose 2), a scripted questionnaire was used to determine if any SAEs had occurred since Day 43, Postdose 2. Subject's parent/legal guardian was also instructed to contact study personnel immediately if a varicella-or herpes zoster-like rash developed. Subjects were required to be seen at the clinic within 72 hours of the rash presentation.",
