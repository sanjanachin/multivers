[11] [12] [13] [14] A large cohort study on young adult men by \u00c5berg et al found a positive association between cardiovascular fitness and intelligence, even after adjusting for relevant confounders. 15 Physical activity seems to improve synaptic plasticity, 16 upregulate cerebral blood flow, 17 increase the efficiency of cognitive control networks, 18 and increase the levels of neurotrophins (eg, brain-derived neurotrophic factor). 19 Animal studies have also shown that running increases neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, improving learning in younger 20 as well as older mice. 21 Naylor et al showed that the brain damage in young mice after cranial irradiation was mitigated by voluntary physical exercise (running), resulting in improved neurogenesis and better neuronal integration of new neurons in the dentate gyrus. 22 The running mice also showed more normal behavior compared to non-running mice. Wolfe et al examined the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and executive functioning in pediatric brain tumor survivors, and found that higher cardiovascular fitness correlated with a more efficient brain activation pattern (measured with fMRI) during a working memory task. 23 Although the \"cardiovascular fitness\" hypothesis suggests that improved cardiovascular fitness through physical activity mediates cognitive performance benefits, 24, 25 it seems that cardiovascular fitness alone does not explain these benefits. 26 According to several studies in healthy young adults, computer (video) games can improve cognitive abilities, such as attention capacity, executive control, and processing speed. [27] [28] [29] Based on these findings one might expect that a combination of physical activity and computer games could have an additive or synergistic positive effect on cognition, as has been suggested by Best. 30 We hypothesized that regular active video gaming (ie, video gaming requiring physical activity, also referred to as exercise gaming or exergaming) by survivors of childhood brain tumors could: i) improve cognitive functions (especially executive function and attention, but potentially also memory functions) and ii) Improve the execution of activities of daily living (ADL).",

[38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] AMPS measures the quality of a person's performance during ADL tasks by evaluating 16 motor skills and 20 process skills. Motor skills are observable actions used to move oneself and objects within a task environment, and process skills refer to the observable actions of a person to organize and adapt task actions to prevent or overcome problems while performing a functional task (eg, searching, locating, and gathering needed objects; initiating, sequencing, and terminating actions appropriately). 36 A trained and calibrated rater (calibrated to compensate for harshness or softness in the judgment of performance) scores performance (using a 4-point ordinal scale according to explicit, specific criteria) in 2 tasks. These tasks are selected from the AMPS collection of analyzed tasks (eg, setting the dinner table for 4 people or making a fruit salad), and should be familiar to the person tested and identified by him or her as presenting problems in everyday life. The raw scores are adjusted for the challenge of the performed task and the severity of the examiner who scored the patient's performance and converted to a linear measure of motor and process skills, expressed as interval-scaled, log-odds probability units (logits), using many-facet Rasch analysis. [44] [45] [46] This was done using the AMPS software, version 2005. A higher ADL motor or ADL process ability measure indicates that the individual is more able, and a change of 0.3 logits is considered a clinically relevant difference. 47 The evaluations took place in each participant's home, at the 3 time points described above ( Fig. 1B) .",

The intervention, which consisted of 10-minute sessions of moderate to vigorous physical activity delivered intermittently throughout the 51 A 9-year intervention study showed that physical education in school 5 days a week, plus adapted motor training if needed, instead of 2 days a week, reduced motor skills deficits from 47% to 7% and increased the proportion of pupils who qualified for upper secondary school from 81% to 97%. 52 Although active video gaming in the present study was performed as intended, the physical activity during active video gaming sessions was of low to moderate intensity, 31 and the overall daily energy expenditure level did not change significantly over the intervention period.

In a juvenile rat model, low-intensity treadmill running increased hippocampal neurogenesis more than high intensity running, suggesting an inverted-U dose response of hippocampal neurogenesis to exercise intensity. 54 Higher intensity exercise does not by default mean better cognitive outcome compared to lower intensity.

Furthermore, the nongamers improved their visual attention capacity after training action video games for just 10 days, compared to a control group playing slower paced games (Tetris). 28 Dye et al compared children playing action video games with those playing nonaction video games and concluded that action video gamers had shorter reaction times without making more errors and had enhanced attentional resources. 55 There is, however, still some debate as to whether the improvements seen in such studies are a result of bias due to study design flaws (eg, differential bias) and if these improvements are transferable to other tasks. 56 In the present study we found a clinically relevant effect in the execution of ADL but no statistically significant effect on any cognitive parameters. Although there is some evidence for low-to-moderate correlations between (the process part of) AMPS and cognitive results in children with hemiparesis, 57 in adults with mild dementia, 58 and stroke, 59 the AMPS process score should not be equated with specific neuropsychological tests, since the relative contributions of specific cognitive abilities to ADL process skills vary across skill items and tasks. 36 The improvements in AMPS scores were not only statistically significant, but also of a clinically meaningful magnitude, indicating that active video gaming could help childhood brain tumor survivors in becoming more independent in their daily lives. Future studies should address if the effect is long lasting as well as the impact it might have on quality of survival.",

Furthermore, the AMPS test has been shown to have high test-retest reliability (AMPS motor r=0.9-0.91; AMPS process r=0.87-0.90). 36 On the other hand, since the waiting-list group did not receive the same amount of attention, we cannot rule out the possibility that the improvements seen could be an unspecific effect from participating in a study.
