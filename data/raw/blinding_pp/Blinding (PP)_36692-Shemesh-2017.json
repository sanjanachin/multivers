        "text": "What is already known about this topic? Anxiety and discomfort related to the need to self-inject epinephrine in an emergency contributes to food-allergic adolescents' occasional failure to use an autoinjector, and may increase their risk when an anaphylactic reaction occurs. What does this article add to our knowledge? A supervised self-injection procedure with an empty syringe improved adolescents' comfort with self-injection, and decreased anxiety related to the anticipated need to self-inject. How does this study impact current management guidelines? A simple self-injection procedure (needle and empty syringe) in addition to standard training is beneficial for adolescents with food allergy who are willing to perform this maneuver. BACKGROUND: Epinephrine self-injection is a key element in the management of food allergy, yet many adolescents report that they may not be able to use the autoinjector when needed. We hypothesized that supervised self-injection with an empty syringe would increase adolescents' comfort with self-injection. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of supervised self-injection on self-and parent-reported comfort and anxiety during and after clinic visits in a food allergy center. METHODS: Sixty adolescent/parent pairs were randomized to self-injection versus control (education only). The predefined primary outcome was a self-reported comfort level with the injection before versus after the intervention on a Likert scale with scores of 1 (Not at all comfortable) to 10 (Extremely comfortable). The primary outcome was evaluated via withingroup and between-group analyses. Secondary outcomes included adolescent and parent reports before versus after the injection, and changes in quality of life (QoL) and anxiety a month later. RESULTS: Self-injection was associated with a significant immediate increase in comfort levels (primary outcome; withingroup comparison: mean scores: 6.93 preintervention vs 8.37 postintervention, P < .01; between-group ANOVA: 8.37 vs 6.69, P < .01) and with significant improvements in all other predefined (secondary) measures. On follow-up, QoL improved in 52% of intervention patients as compared with 25% of controls; similar differences were observed for anxiety. Those differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: A self-injection (with an empty syringe) procedure in a clinic setting improves adolescents' and parents' comfort level with self-injecting. It may translate into substantial clinical benefits should self-injection be needed.",

Our primary outcome measure, a pre-post evaluation immediately after the injection, is not subject to recall bias as it was assessed immediately after the event. The procedure was beneficial as determined by a statistically significant improvement in the adolescents' self-reported comfort with self-injection (our predefined primary endpoint) both in within-subject and between-subject analyses, with a large effect size, and as further demonstrated by multiple additional indicators. The nonsignificant improvements in QoL and anxiety observed between the immediate postinjection period and follow-up are encouraging. The effects of an intervention that is specifically targeting subject's feeling at the time of an urgent event (the need to autoinject) may not be apparent in the absence of such an event. Therefore, the signal that the procedure may have generalized into an improvement even in the safety of one's home on followup is a positive sign, but we caution that we were unable to investigate whether intervention patients who undergo this procedure are, in fact, able to use the autoinjector more easily or accurately when needed. The study was not designed to evaluate responses during a true anaphylactic emergency given the rarity of such events. Such a study would require extremely large numbers of patients followed over years. Our results show that patients are less anxious about self-injecting and more comfortable with it. In addition, although the intervention effect size was large, the minimal clinical effect threshold for some of the instruments is not known, and therefore a larger and longer investigation would need to be conducted to prove that the benefits that we saw translate into lasting clinical benefits. Imaginal or gradual exposure to a stressor is a hallmark of cognitive-behavioral procedures that were shown to be effective in the treatment of phobias 12 and anxiety disorders. 24, 25 Our approach has important features of these well-accepted approaches in that we exposed subjects to a simulation of the very circumstance that they may fear. In other settings, exposure techniques were shown to reduce avoidance behaviors and improve adherence to medical recommendations. 26, 27 In the food-allergy setting, this may translate into a higher likelihood of using the autoinjector when indicated; epinephrine administered by intramuscular self-injectors is safe and generally well tolerated. 28 Anecdotally, investigators in our study reported that the most anxious patients, who were reluctant to participate in the trial at first, were also those who showed the most benefit, but our study was not designed to evaluate which patients would benefit the most. Our study was limited by the fact that the procedure, by necessity, was not masked, and by a likely selection bias. Because of the requirement for patient assent (not only parent consent), only subjects who agreed to the procedure were enrolled, likely resulting in exclusion of the most anxious patients or parents. Indeed, we have observed instances in which the adolescent would not provide assent despite parental consent. It could be that anxious patients might have been even more likely to benefit from the procedure. Alternatively, it could also be that very anxious patients, who might have been excluded by the required assent process, would not have benefitted if enrolled. The correct interpretation of our results is that the procedure can be helpful for adolescents who agree to do it. Another source of potential selection bias is the fact that the majority, but not all, of the patients returned the follow-up questionnaires. It could be that the observed sustained improvements in QoL and anxiety are because only those patients who improved returned the questionnaires. This is unlikely, however, because almost as many control subjects returned the follow-up questionnaire as intervention subjects (21 controls vs 24 intervention). Finally, our results are further limited by the fact that the procedure was offered in one specialized center with a specific patient characteristic profile-mainly white, highly educated, and high-income parents. A larger study incorporating measures of actual adherence (likelihood of carrying an autoinjector after the procedure, for example) is needed to conclusively prove a lasting clinical benefit.",

We did not have access to a sham autoinjector with an actual needle as this kind of device is not currently being manufactured, and therefore used a simple needle, which is available in any clinic. A sham autoinjector, if it becomes available, might have been an even better simulator. As it stands, our intervention could be offered in select clinical circumstances (eg, when adolescents and parents agree; when the adolescent seems to be anxious about the prospect of needing an injection). This simple, quick, behavioral intervention is easy to deliver, does not require special expertise, and may result in improved QoL and attendant clinical benefits. 3.
