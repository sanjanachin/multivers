Parental supervision and monitoring of adolescent diabetes management have been shown to promote better diabetes management among adolescents, but parents typically decrease their oversight during the transition to independent diabetes care. Introduction: The purpose of the study was to conduct a randomized clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of a three-session, computer-delivered motivational intervention (The 3Ms) to promote increased parental monitoring among primary caregivers of young African American adolescents with T1D. The intervention was brief and optimized for delivery during routine diabetes clinic visits. Materials and Methods: Sixty-seven adolescents with T1D aged 11-14 and their primary caregiver were randomly assigned to one of three arms: adolescent and parent motivational intervention (Arm 1), adolescent control and parent motivational intervention (Arm 2), or adolescent and parent control (Arm 3). Intervention effects were assessed 1 month after intervention completion. Results: Parents in Arm 1 and Arm 2 had significant increases in knowledge of the importance of monitoring adolescents' diabetes care. Parents in Arm 2 also had trend to significant increases in direct observation and monitoring of adolescent diabetes care, and adolescents in Arm 2 had significant improvements in glycemic control. Discussion and Conclusions: Findings from the present study provide preliminary support for the efficacy of a brief, computerdelivered parenting intervention for improving family management practices and adolescent health outcomes among African American adolescents with T1D and their caregivers.",

Although maintenance of near-normal blood glucose is important to avoid complications, adolescents often have difficulty following the demanding self-care regimen required to achieve this goal, which includes administration of insulin, monitoring blood glucose levels, and tracking carbohydrate intake on a daily basis. Adolescents are more likely than children or adults to be poorly adherent with almost every aspect of type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Suboptimal diabetes management is an important factor in the development of chronic high blood glucose levels (poor metabolic control). 6 African American adolescents in particular have been found to be at significantly higher risk for problems with diabetes management and metabolic control. [7] [8] [9] [10] Parental monitoring refers to parenting behaviors that involve information seeking about the youth's daily activities, as well as direct supervision and oversight of those activities. 11 Low levels of parental monitoring have been linked to a broad range of problem adolescent behaviors, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] including poor diabetes care.

There were no significant increases in either of these areas for any treatment arm.

The lack of change in family conflict was notable in light of this increased parental oversight.

In addition, increased family conflict could have led to adverse effects such as decreased self-esteem on the part of the adolescent.
