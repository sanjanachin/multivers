The developmental malleability of cognitive control capacity in this age group, however, may hold particular promise for cognitive training interventions. The present study investigated the effects of affective working memory (aWMT) compared to placebo-training on cognitive and affective functioning in adolescents with PTSD. 30 treatment-seeking adolescents trained for 20 days on either an affective dual n-back task (aWMT; n \u00bc 15) or a feature match task (placebo; n \u00bc 15). The aWMT group showed greater pre-to post-training increases in cognitive control as measured by the GoNogo task as well as improvements in symptoms of PTSD and increased use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. These preliminary findings are promising given the potential for free and easy dissemination of the aWMT in schools and online.",

        "text": "Adolescence is a time of heightened risk for exposure to traumatic events (Hanson et al., 2008) and subsequent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Kilpatrick et al., 2003; Merikangas et al., 2010) . The impact of PTSD on the mind at one of the peaks in cognitive and affective development (Steinberg, 2005) is arguably particularly devastating as it is associated with impairment in a host of critical cognitive functions including memory and attention (for a review see: Hayes, VanElzakker, & Shin, 2012) . A cognitive domain that may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of adolescent PTSD is executive functioning, specifically cognitive control. Cognitive control refers to individuals' capacity to select and attend towards goal-relevant information, while inhibiting attention and responses to irrelevant stimuli (Koechlin, Ody, & Kouneiher, 2003) . Its underlying neural substrates in the frontoparietal control network undergo rapid development during adolescence and well into early adulthood (Blakemore & Choudhury, 2006) . Previous research has shown cognitive control to be significantly impaired in PTSD with concurrent changes in this same frontoparietal control network (Aupperle, Melrose, Stein, & Paulus, 2012) . While the etiological mechanisms through which cognitive control may be associated with the development and/or maintenance of symptoms of PTSD remain to be explored (Aupperle et al., 2012; Casey, Tottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005) , potential pathways include (cf., Aupperle et al., 2012) : inhibiting attention and responses toward potential triggers of unwanted memories (Catarino, K\u00fcpper, Werner-Seidler, Dalgleish, & Anderson, 2015) ; difficulties in disengaging attention from traumarelated stimuli (Pineles, Shipherd, Mostoufi, Abramovitz, & Yovel, 2009) ; and inability to inhibit maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., avoidance) in favor of more adaptive strategies (e.g., reappraisal; Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Schweizer, 2010) . Critically, these putative mechanisms involve difficulties in the application of cognitive control in affective contexts. Any interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive control in PTSD should therefore do so in affective contexts. Data from the adult literature shows psychological interventions for PTSD to be successful at treating symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorders (Lee et al., 2016; Watts et al., 2013) . Notably, however, these treatments place considerable demands on cognitive control over affective information (e.g., restructuring a trauma memory) and require patients to override pre-potent emotion regulatory responses to engage in more adaptive strategies. Increasing cognitive control in adolescents suffering from PTSD may therefore further augment, or speed up the treatment success of psychological interventions relying heavily on cognitive capacity.",

        "text": "In the current study we aimed to improve cognitive control in adolescents suffering from PTSD using an affective working memory training (aWMT), which relies heavily on applying cognitive control in affective contexts (Engen & Kanske, 2013; . Specifically, we used a culturally and developmentally modified version of the aWMT protocol from Schweizer, Grahn, Hampshire, Mobbs, and Dalgleish (2013; , which has been shown to augment cognitive control over affective information at both automatic (measured with an emotional Stroop task) and volitional (measured with a film-based emotion regulation task) levels of processing in healthy adults. Furthermore, at the neural level of analysis participants receiving aWMT showed optimized recruitment of the frontoparietal control network during emotion regulation after the training intervention, compared to a sham training group . The aWMT is a dual nback task that requires participants to update and maintain visual (faces with affective expressions) and auditory (affectively-laden words) information. Participants have to indicate whether the face they are currently seeing is in the same spatial location as the one presented n positions back and/or whether the word they are hearing is the same as the one heard n trials ago (n is always titrated at participants' optimal performance level). Critically, the affective expression of the faces must be ignored, while the content of the words must be attended to for optimal task performance. Previous research has shown that early life trauma is associated with altered processing of negative facial expressions (i.e., increased attentional biases toward negative information and increased amygdala activation), especially threatening information such as angry faces (e.g., Dannlowski et al., 2012) . Ignoring the affective content of these faces might therefore be especially challenging to this adolescent sample with PTSD. More generally, PTSD has been associated with altered emotional processing of a wide range of affective stimuli including emotional scripts, faces, words, and images (for a review see: Etkin & Wager, 2007) with patients showing prepotent attentional orienteering biases toward negative information (Bar-Haim, Lamy, Pergamin, Bakermans- Kranenburg & van IJzendoorn, 2007; El Khoury-Malhame et al., 2011) . The challenges posed by the task for the adolescents with PTSD might then be two-fold: first, inhibiting attention toward the affective content of the facial stimuli whilst recording their spatial location and second, to attend to and disengage from the negative words as appropriate to continuously successfully update them in WM.",

However, it should be noted this finding is in contrast with previous studies showing cognitive control training to lead to reduced report of maladaptive (ruminative brooding) but not increased adaptive strategies (e.g., Hoorelbeke, Koster, Demeyer, Loeys, & Vanderhasselt, 2016; Siegle et al., 2014) . A potential account for these discrepant findings is that the aWMT requires individuals to exert cognitive control over affective stimuli. Arguably the affective stimuli make this aWMT a closer approximation to the deployment of cognitive control in the presence of affective information (endo-and exogenous) encountered in everyday life e compared to a \"cold\" neuropsychological training task such as the adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Attention Task used in the studies showing no transfer to adaptive emotion regulation (Hoorelbeke et al., 2016; Siegle et al., 2014) . However, the current study did not include a neutral WMT control condition. Consequently, it is possible that training-related gains were a function of WMT with the affective component having no impact on any of the observed transfer effects (Becker, Vanderhasselt, & Vrijsen, 2015; Keshavan, Vinogradov, Rumsey, Sherrill, & Wagner, 2014) .

            "Particularly, encouraging was the finding that aWMT was not only associated with gains in cognitive control but also augmented use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and greater reduction in posttraumatic stress symptoms.",

            "However, it should be noted this finding is in contrast with previous studies showing cognitive control training to lead to reduced report of maladaptive (ruminative brooding) but not increased adaptive strategies (e.g., Hoorelbeke, Koster, Demeyer, Loeys, & Vanderhasselt, 2016; Siegle et al., 2014) .",
            "A potential account for these discrepant findings is that the aWMT requires individuals to exert cognitive control over affective stimuli.",
            "Arguably the affective stimuli make this aWMT a closer approximation to the deployment of cognitive control in the presence of affective information (endo-and exogenous) encountered in everyday life e compared to a \"cold\" neuropsychological training task such as the adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Attention Task used in the studies showing no transfer to adaptive emotion regulation (Hoorelbeke et al., 2016; Siegle et al., 2014) .",
            "However, the current study did not include a neutral WMT control condition.",

        "text": "The results from the current study need to be interpreted with caution, however, given the small sample size. Significant effects in small samples are likely to represent an overestimation of the effect in the population (Button et al., 2013) . Similarly, promising results have been observed for other computerized training interventions when small sample sizes were included (Amir, Beard, Burns, & Bomyea, 2009) but later failed to reliably replicate (Mogoa\u015f e, David, & Koster, 2008) . It is therefore critical to replicate the current findings in future research, ideally conducted by a different research group. Secondly, the placebo-training task in the current study did not include any affective stimuli, which makes it possible that the transfer effects to posttraumatic stress symptoms and use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies were due to repeated exposure to negative stimuli (Foa, Chrestman, & Gilboa-Schechtman, 2008) . To address this issue we have developed an analogue placebo task including the visual stimuli from the aWMT and our preliminary findings have shown this affective placebo task to have no effect on symptoms of depression nor cognitive control (Schweizer, Carbon-Lee, Auer, Hampshire, & Dalgleish, 2016) , though of course it may still impact on symptoms of PTSD. Moreover, the findings on the cognitive control task (i.e., GoNogo) in the current study are unlikely to be accounted for by exposure effects as the GoNogo task did not include affective material. Another limitation of the study design is that the transfer tasks included neither a non-trained measure of WM, nor a behavioral measure of affective control such as the emotional Stroop task (Kahan & Hely, 2008) . Transfer to these measures have, however, previously been shown using the aWMT in healthy adults (Schweizer et al., 2016 . Furthermore, training-related changes in emotion regulation and symptoms of posttraumatic stress were assessed using self-report questionnaires, which are prone to demand effects. And while participants were blind to their treatment allocation both training conditions were administered in class, which makes it possible (even likely) that participants were aware of the intervention condition they were in. That is, one of the training tasks was clearly affective and the other was affect-neutral. Given the nature of their condition participants were likely to deduce which of the two training conditions was intended as the active condition. Moreover, the placebo group significantly differed from the aWMT group at pre-training, showing lower levels of cognitive control (more errors on the GoNogo task) and reporting using more adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. This raises the possibility that the training might be more efficient in individuals who have a higher cognitive control capacity at baseline. Secondly, it is possible that the greater gains in adaptive emotion regulation strategies in the aWMT group were in part due to with the placebo group having less room for improvement. On a positive note, the design did support the feasibility of running these type of computerized training interventions in school settings. Inferences from the current sample are further limited by the fact that only participants with a \"pure\" diagnosis of PTSD were invited to the study, whereas research in adolescence has shown that 40% of individuals with an axis one disorder have a comorbid disorder (Merikangas et al., 2010) . Training effects may be attenuated, or enhanced, in those with a comorbid diagnoses or may depend on the nature of the comorbidity. Finally, the current study included generic negative stimuli. Using trauma-specific stimuli may make the training task even more effective in terms of augmenting patients' cognitive control over unwanted trauma-related thoughts and feelings.",
