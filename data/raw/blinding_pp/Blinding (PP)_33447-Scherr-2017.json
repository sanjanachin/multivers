Setting: Schools in northern and central California. Participants: Fourth-graders (aged 9-10 years) at 2 control schools (n \u00bc 179) and 2 intervention schools (n \u00bc 230). Intervention: Garden-enhanced education, family, and community partnerships; increased regionally procured produce in the lunchroom; and school-site wellness committees. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in body mass index (BMI) percentiles/Z-scores; nutrition knowledge, science process skills, and vegetable identification and preferences; and reported fruit and vegetable intake. Analysis: Student t test, chi-square, ANOVA of change, and multilevel regression mixed model to evaluate change in outcomes with school as a random effect to account for cluster design effects. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. Results: There was a greater improvement in BMI percentile (\u00c06.08; P < 0.01), BMI Z-score (\u00c00.28; P < .001), and waist-to-height ratio (\u00c00.02; P < .001) in the intervention compared with the control schools. Conclusions and Implications: The SHCP resulted in improvements in nutrition knowledge, vegetable identification, and a significant decrease in BMI percentiles. This supports the concept that the SHCP can be used to improve the health of upper elementary school students.",

Detailed descriptions of assessment measures are published elsewhere and include demographics, nutrition knowledge, Test of Basic Science Process Skills (BAPS), vegetable identification and preferences, dietary intake through food frequency questionnaires, anthropometrics, physical activity, parent feeding practices, and general parenting practices. 30 Statistical methods. Students were included in the analyses if they completed both pre-and post-measures for each variable. Data were multilevel, with school as the unit of randomization and data collected from students as the unit of analysis. For continuous variables, means and SDs were calculated and distributions were examined for normality using a combination of histogram, skewness, and kurtosis. Student t test or a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups, as appropriate. Baseline student outcomes were compared between control and intervention subjects and statistical differences are indicated when necessary by proper annotations. For categorical variables, percentages were calculated and groups were compared using chi-square test for homogeneity or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Changes in outcome between the pre-and postmeasure were calculated by subtracting pre-scores from post-scores. The researchers used ANOVA of change to analyze whether changes in outcomes were significantly different between students participating in the intervention compared with control subjects. Chi-square analysis was used to detect differences in BMI classification between pre-measure and post-measure. A multilevel generalized (regression) mixed model was used to evaluate change in outcomes with school as a random effect to account for cluster design effects. The intra-class correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the correlation across multiple levels in the data. All variables were assessed for collinearity before being included in the model. The researchers decided a priori to include race/ethnicity and household income in the multivariable model because of their conceptual importance. 23 Akaike information criterion statistics 36 determined the final model, which included predetermined confounders.

        "text": "Results of the SHCP intervention demonstrated that students who participated had significant improvements in nutrition knowledge, identification of vegetables, BMI percentiles/Z-scores, BMI classification, and waist-to-height ratios compared with control students, especially in the Northern California district. These results suggest that when the SHCP was fully implemented inside the classroom and beyond, concomitant improvements in individual and environmental factors may have had interdependent effects that led to improvement in children's BMI. Other interventions demonstrated varying degrees of success in these areas; however, the magnitude of change observed in the current study provided more robust evidence to support multicomponent interventions. Although the prevalence of overweight and obese children at the Northern California intervention school was higher than the national average, this level is common in certain sectors of the population. Several states have a mean prevalence of overweight and obese children near 35%. 41 For example, Illinois has a prevalence of approximately 34% of children who are overweight or obese; however, looking at Chicago more closely, in several neighborhoods values are near 50%. 42 Similarly, in New York several school districts across the state have a prevalence of overweight and obesity that fall in the 40% to 50% range. 43 Clearly when one considers the range of childhood overweight and obesity throughout the US, the results of the current study can be generalized to many school districts and counties in the country. Previous research has examined the impact of multicomponent interventions on childhood overweight and obesity in areas with higher than average prevalence. 37 For example, when comparing the SHCP to a study with similar prevalence of overweight and obesity, the resulting shifts in BMI percentiles and shifts into healthier weight status categories were more marked among students participating in the SHCP. 37 Significant improvements in nutrition knowledge and identification of vegetables were consistent with results of previous studies evaluating gardenenhanced nutrition education. [6] [7] [8] [9] It is reasonable to suggest that the significant improvements in vegetable identification stemmed from consistent reinforcement in multiple venues. Continual reinforcement of classroom education by coordinated messaging throughout program components was a critical aspect to the SHCP. For example, students grew and harvested their own vegetables, which were then used in cooking demonstrations or taken home. Produce served in the lunchroom reflected the garden harvest and were featured in family newsletters. Although significant improvements in total vegetable identification were noted at the intervention schools in both districts, more individual vegetables were identified at the Northern California intervention compared with the Central Valley intervention school. A possible explanation for this is that the Northern California intervention school completed all classroom activities and all cooking demonstrations, and participated in 3 garden harvests. Identification of chard, spinach, kohlrabi, yellow squash, and radish all improved significantly at this school and were featured in the cooking demonstrations, and all but yellow squash were grown in the garden. In contrast, the Central Valley intervention school did not improve vegetable identification pertaining to items that were not grown in the garden. This further reinforces the importance of the cooking demonstrations and the use of a salad bar to enhance the curriculum and garden exposure to improve recognition of vegetables, a predictor of vegetable intake. 14 The lack of improvement in preferences for vegetables may be explained by observations made during postevaluations but not captured by the vegetable preferences tool. Some students declined to taste the vegetables and specifically stated that they did not want to taste them again because they were already familiar with the taste.

Although newsletters are a common form of school communication with parents, it is difficult to ascertain whether parents read them. Future research should consider ways to track who reads newsletters and explore alternative options for parent education components of school-based interventions to understand how to bridge home and school effectively. 46 Results from the multilevel regression model indicate different responses to the intervention between the 2 school districts. When the districts were combined, the effect of the intervention was not a significant predictor for change in BMI percentile.

Table 2 identifies key areas in which implementation was inconsistent between the 2 intervention schools.
