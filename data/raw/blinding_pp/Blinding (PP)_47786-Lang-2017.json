Methods: A total of 79 T1DM patients were randomly divided into MSII1 group with 30 cases (the patients were given insulin aspart before meals followed by one-time injection of insulin detemir at bedtime), MSII2 group of 26 cases (the patients were given insulin aspart before meals followed by twotime injection of insulin detemir respectively at bedtime and in the early morning) and CSII group of 23 cases. Fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose, C-peptide, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin dosage and incidence of hypoglycemia were detected and compared among the three groups after 3 months and 6 months' treatment. Results: After treatment, the fasting blood glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin decreased in all three groups with the values in the MSII2 group and CSII group lower than those in MSII1 group of statistical significance. There was no significant difference between the MSII2 group and CSII group. In addition, there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia among those three groups. The insulin dosage used in the CSII group was lower than that in the MSII1 group and the MSII2 group. Conclusion: The treatment of insulin pump combined with insulin aspart before meals followed by twotime injection of insulin detemir is more effective than single long-acting insulin injection in the control of blood sugar of the patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.",

Type 1 diabetes is more common in young boys and girls who often have poor islet beta cell function with the difficulty in control of blood sugar, which is prone to cause serious complications like Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).
