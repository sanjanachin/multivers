        "text": "Background: A talus control foot orthosis (TCFO) combines an inverted rigid foot orthosis (RFO) with a broad upright portion that rises well above the navicular to cover and protect the talonavicular joint. We sought to identify the therapeutic effect of TCFOs in children with flexible flatfoot. Methods: Flexible flatfoot was diagnosed in 40 children when either of the feet had greater than 48 valgus of resting calcaneal stance position (RCSP) angle and one of the radiographic indicators was greater than 308 in anteroposterior talocalcaneal angles, 458 in lateral talocalcaneal angles, and 48 in lateral talometatarsal angles and less than 108 of calcaneal pitch in barefoot radiographs. Of 40 children with flexible flatfoot, 20 were fitted with a pair of RFOs and 20 with TCFOs, randomly. Follow-up clinical and radiographic measurements were completed 12 months later. Results: All of the radiographic indicators changed toward the corrective direction in both groups. There were significant improvements in calcaneal pitch and RCSP in both groups (P , .05). In the TCFO group, the anteroposterior talocalcaneal angle and the RCSP showed statistically significant improvement compared with the RFO group. Conclusions: In this study, the TCFO was more effective than the RFO at treating children with flexible flatfoot.",

Thus, the medial longitudinal ligaments have to resist the excessive and prolonged force by abnormal range of pronation. 14 Symptoms of flatfoot are usually accompanied by anatomical abnormalities such as subtalar subluxation, medial protrusion, and collapse of the medial longitudinal arch caused by talar adduction and plantarflexion, tibial internal rotation, calcaneal eversion, and plantarflexion at the subtalar joint. Also, forefoot abduction occurs at the midtarsal joint, which results in more relative supination in the forefoot compared with the hindfoot. 16 Treatment of flexible flatfoot has been the subject of controversy among scholars, especially nonsurgical treatment using foot orthoses. The effectiveness of a variety of foot orthoses and shoes has been examined in many studies, with diverse opinions on their efficacy. 9, 10, 12, [17] [18] [19] In a study by Wenger et al, 17 children with flexible flatfoot aged 1 to 6 years wore orthopedic shoes, heel cups, and custom-molded plastic inserts (University of California Biomechanics Laboratory, San Francisco, California); however, no significant difference was found between the control and treatment groups. However, in that study, old-style foot orthoses were used, and they enrolled children with flatfoot younger than 6 years, who were still developing the medial longitudinal arch.

Therefore, we included children older than 6 years and measured both RCSP and radiographic measurements to enhance the reliability of the results.",
