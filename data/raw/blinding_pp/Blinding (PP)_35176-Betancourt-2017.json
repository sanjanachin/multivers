We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Family Strengthening Intervention (FSI-HIV), a family home-visiting intervention to promote mental health and improve parent-child relationships in families with caregivers living with HIV hypothesizing that child and family outcomes would be superior to usual care social work services. Methods-82 families (N=170 children, 48.24% female; N=123 caregivers, 68.29% female) with at least one HIV-positive caregiver (n=103, 83.74%) and school-aged child (ages 7-17) (HIV+ n=21, 12.35%) were randomized to receive FSI-HIV or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Local research assistants blind to treatment conducted assessments of child mental health, parenting practices, and family functioning at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up.

The theory behind the original FBPI (also called \"Family Talk\") is that poor communication and negative parent-child dynamics due to chronic parental illness can lead to increased risk of mental health problems in offspring. The FSI-HIV adapted this family-based approach, originally developed for the prevention of depression in the offspring of depressed caregivers to the context of families affected by caregiver HIV. The original FBPI has a strong evidence base in several diverse cultural settings. The intervention has received high rankings in the National Registry of Evidencebased Programs and Practices (NREPP, 2009) . It has been adapted for use with different cultural groups including Latino and Native American populations in the United States and has been integrated into health services in Costa Rica and Finland (Beardslee et al., 2011; Beardslee et al., 2013; D'Angelo et al., 2009; Podorefsky, McDonald-Dowdell, & Beardslee, 2001; Sparrow et al., 2011) . In prior trials, participation in the intervention was associated with increased family understanding of depression, and decreased depressive symptomatology scores in children (Beardslee et al., 2003; Beardslee et al., 2007; D'Angelo et al., 2009; Podorefsky et al., 2001) . Given the FBPI's focus on improving the caregiverchild relationship and communication in the context of chronic caregiver illness, the FBPI was seen as well aligned with the challenges within families that can contribute to the high rates of mental health problems that have been observed in HIV-affected children (Betancourt, Scorza, et al., 2014) . Like the original FBPI, FSI-HIV is strengths-based and has at its core the development of a family narrative that draws out the major challenges that the family has faced together and the inherent strengths that have helped the family to overcome challenges in the past with a view toward continued future success as a family through improved communication and understanding. The narrative and strengths focus of the FBPI were seen as aligned with views of resilience among families facing adversity in Rwanda as illuminated in prior qualitative research on protective processes in this setting.",

First, reductions in child depression symptoms were achieved with FSI-HIV delivered by bachelor-level counselors with FSI-HIV training, demonstrating potential to help address the limited resources for mental health services in Rwanda. Second, the home-visiting model was effective in engaging mothers and fathers in dual-caregiver households. Third, this study adds to the literature by extending the intervention focus beyond children directly infected by HIV or children orphaned by HIV to also provide a model for promoting the mental health of children living in households where at least one caregiver has HIV. This allows for a focus on children directly and indirectly affected by HIV, which is extremely pertinent in today's environment with longer life expectancies among people living with HIV (Nsanzimana et al., 2015) . In particular, coaching parents to use positive parenting practices and improved communication and listening may have contributed to reductions in children's depression and improvements in prosocial behavior both in HIV-infected children and in children who are HIV-negative but indirectly affected by family HIV.",
