        "text": "We investigated the exercise intensity and fitness effects of frequent school-based low-volume high-intensity training for 10 months in 8-10-year-old children. 239 Danish 3rd-grade school children from four schools were cluster-randomised into a control group (CON, = 116) or two training groups performing either 5\u00d712 min/wk small-sided football plus other ball games (SSG, = 62) or interval running (IR, = 61). Whole-body DXA scans, flamingo balance, standing long-jump, 20 m sprint, and Yo-Yo IR1 children's tests (YYIR1C) were performed before and after the intervention. Mean running velocity was higher (< 0.05) in SSG than in IR (0.88 \u00b1 0.14 versus 0.63 \u00b1 0.20 m/s), while more time (< 0.05) was spent in the highest player load zone (>2; 5.6 \u00b1 3.4 versus 3.7 \u00b1 3.4%) and highest HR zone (>90% HR max ; 12.4 \u00b1 8.9 versus 8.4 \u00b1 8.0%) in IR compared to SSG. After 10 months, no significant between-group differences were observed for YYIR1C performance and HR after 2 min of YYIR1C (HR submax), but median-split analyses showed that HR submax was reduced (< 0.05) in both training groups compared to CON for those with the lowest aerobic fitness (SSG versus CON: 3.2% HR max [95% CI: 0.8-5.5]; IR versus CON: 2.6% HR max [95% CI: 1.1-5.2]). After 10 months, IR had improved (< 0.05) 20 m sprint performance (IR versus CON: 154 ms [95% CI: 61-241]). No between-group differences (> 0.05) were observed for whole-body or leg aBMD, lean mass, postural balance, or jump length. In conclusion, frequent low-volume ball games and interval running can be conducted over a full school year with high intensity rate but has limited positive fitness effects in 8-10-year-old children.",

After the standardised warmup, the children were placed behind a line with their feet parallel and shoulder-width apart. They first performed the CMJ and then the SJ after a 2-minute rest period. In both jumps, distance from the starting line to the heel closed to the line was measured. This is a reliable method [33] and maximal horizontal jump performance is well correlated to leg muscle strength in children [34, 35] . 2.7. Coordination. Time to complete a coordination wall with three stages of increased difficulty was used to evaluate coordination abilities [36] .

        "text": "Considering the lack of effects of training on jump length and body weight observed in the current study, it may be speculated that the improvements in sprinting performance relate to improvements in coordination and anaerobic power rather than leg muscle strength. The frequent low-volume SSG and IR were not sufficient to improve the bone mineralisation and muscular fitness of 8-10-year-old school children despite the fact that the player loads were similar to those found in another FIT FIRST study that examined effects of medium-volume interventions (3 \u00d7 40 min SSG or circuit strength training) [27] . In the latter study, marked improvements were observed in jump length, sprint performance, and bone mineralisation over the same 10-month intervention period [27] . The explanations for this difference may be the bigger training volume and the fact that the sessions in the latter study were more than 3 times longer (40 min versus 12 min), so these children spent more time in the fatigued state, which may be a major factor contributing to higher bone strains, since under such circumstances muscle ability to absorb shocks is lower [40] . Bone strains are difficult to determine in humans, whereas it is possible to measure the ground reaction forces and, as done in the present study, the player load, which can provide indirect information about the skeletal loading and the resulting strains. Other studies have reported site-specific changes in aBMD and BMC in prepubertal boys and girls with training volumes as low as 3 \u00d7 10 min/wk [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] involving high-impact exercises such as jumping, indicating that it is possible to induce bone mineralisation with even lower training volumes than those investigated in the present study. Taken together, this may indicate that bone healthrelated (osteogenic) responses to exercise depend not only on the strain magnitude and rates induced by training but also on exercise duration in each of the training sessions and the overall training volume, respectively. The heart rate recordings showed that the average HR was 74% HR max in SSG and IR with about 40% of the training time with HR above 80% HR max and 8.4 and 12.4%, respectively, of the time in the highest aerobic training zone above 90% HR max . These findings clearly show that brief sessions with SSG as well as IR could be performed with high average intensity and with periods of near-maximal aerobic loading. Previous studies have shown marked positive effects on YYIR1C performance for 8-10-year old school children of 2 \u00d7 30 min of weekly training with a comparable heart rate response [11] . Thus, large improvements in both maximal and submaximal YYIR1C performances were reported after 6 weeks of SSG, whereas the control group performing lowto-moderate PE activities had no effects on YYIR1C performance or submaximal HR scores during the YYIR1C. In the present study, we analysed the between-group differences in change scores over the full 10-month period, and no significant differences were observed in the changes between training groups and the control group. However, median-split analysis focusing on the subjects with the poorest baseline level revealed positive effects on HR submax , indicating that the former group can achieve improved fitness by frequent lowvolume exercise interventions. On one hand, these findings indicate that frequent brief intense training sessions may not have a very pronounced effect on intermittent exercise performance and aerobic fitness for the average Danish 8-10-year-old school child, but, on the other hand, a high attendance rate and positive training effects were observed for those children with the lowest aerobic fitness, suggesting that these time-efficient training types are worth considering when planning PE sessions aiming at improving aerobic fitness of those that need it the most.",

            "On one hand, these findings indicate that frequent brief intense training sessions may not have a very pronounced effect on intermittent exercise performance and aerobic fitness for the average Danish 8-10-year-old school child, but, on the other hand, a high attendance rate and positive training effects were observed for those children with the lowest aerobic fitness, suggesting that these time-efficient training types are worth considering when planning PE sessions aiming at improving aerobic fitness of those that need it the most."
