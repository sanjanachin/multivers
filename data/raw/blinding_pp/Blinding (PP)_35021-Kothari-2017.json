After children are removed from their families and placed into foster care in the aftermath of maltreatment, the sibling relationship is often the most viable ongoing relationship available to the child, and may be critical to a youth's sense of connection, emotional support, and continuity. The promise of dyadic sibling programming in particular rests on the ability of interventions to enhance the quality of sibling relationships; yet little research exists that suggests that sibling interventions can improve relationship quality among foster youth. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the effects of a specific dyadic sibling-focused intervention for older and younger siblings on sibling relationship quality. One hundred sixty four dyads (328 youth) participated in the study, with each dyad consisting of an older sibling between 11 and 15 years of age at baseline and a younger sibling separated in age by less than 4 years. Hierarchical linear models were applied to self-reported, observer-reported and observational data over the 18-month study period. Findings suggest that the sibling intervention holds promise for improving sibling relationship quality among youth in foster care. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.",

A SIBS-FC project staff member who was also employed by the State of Oregon DHS conducted participant recruitment into the SIBS-FC study. This coordinator had access to the administra- tive database containing child and family information from which a determination of eligibility could be made. Potential participants were identified from all Oregon DHS clients if they met age inclusion criteria (i.e., older siblings between the ages of 11 and 15 with a younger sibling up to four years younger), spoke English, and were residing in the three-county Portland metropolitan region. As wards of the state with established permanency and services plans, youth were eligible if they had been in formal foster care for over one quarter. Once an eligible dyad was identified, their caseworker was notified and consent to participate was requested. Given that Oregon courts require that sibling visitation be supported for children living apart from one another, caseworkers helped facilitate participation in this study because they saw this as a way to get siblings together. The State of Oregon acts as the legal guardian for youth in foster care; therefore, the caseworker for each eligible youth was responsible for determining whether or not there were any concerns that would preclude a particular youth or dyad from participating in the study. Caseworkers declined youth enrollment in instances where youth were experiencing significant challenges (e.g., on the run, severe mental health or behavioral issues, medically fragile). Following DHS consent, foster parents were sent an informational packet by mail and then contacted by phone to invite them and youth to participate in a formal orientation. The orientation was generally conducted in the home of the foster parent(s) by the DHS liaison. Families were provided with a description of the project, the intervention, and the design of the research study; were made aware of potential risks and benefits of participation; and were provided with answers to any questions. For children living apart, a separate orientation was held for each family. Occasionally a foster youth would have a sibling who was age-eligible for the program but was not in foster care; this did not preclude the sibling living with a birth parent from participating. Similar orientation procedures were followed in these cases with minor adaptations in language that reflected the nature of the biological parent-child relationship. Participating families completed consent and assent forms as well as authorizations for obtaining and releasing information to the youths' schools. During orientation, families were also informed of upcoming sibling community events. If a youth changed placement, an attempt was made to contact, orient, and recruit the current caregiver to continue to collect data on each reporting agent over time. Most of the time, foster parents would agree to let the foster children continue to participate even if they themselves were not interested in participating. All eligible youth did speak English.",

        "text": "A more fine-tuned approach may be needed to understand time-based changes in the sibling relationship among youth in foster care. That is, it may be important to examine aspects of sibling relationship quality separately (e.g., sibling intimacy vs. conflict), or to account for the compositional nature of the sibling dyad (older sister-younger sister, older sister-younger brother, older brother-younger brother, and older brother-younger sister). Siblings' previous history together and the degree of contact that they currently have or that they have had in the past may be other factors to consider, especially among foster youth, who may have spent time living separately with little or no previous contact. Their individual needs may also be related to their previous child welfare experiences and/or their roles in their current placement, which may involve other youth, including foster siblings. Future studies should examine these possibilities to better understand the factors that contribute to sibling relationship changes among foster youth. Future investigations may also want to take a more nuanced measurement approach in understanding some of the contextual factors that are important (e.g., living situation with sibling). Living apart may mean, for instance, that one sibling moves towards permanency and one sibling remains in foster care. Moreover, future work should aim to go beyond the sibling dyad to incorporate larger sibling groups. Methodologically, multi-agent, multi-method strategies are recommended, particularly as younger individuals may not always be able to accurately report on their sibling relationship. It is also important that child welfare data systems reliably track the presence and stability of sibling co-placements and evaluate the quality of sibling bonds over time for foster youth (McBeath et al., 2014) .",

Perhaps when pre-adolescents and adolescents in foster care live in a separate home from their sibling, the sibling relationship becomes particularly salient. Under these circumstances, youth may have cognitive and emotional understanding of the importance of their siblings, and may focus more on the quality of relationship with their sibling. As a result, youth may dedicate additional effort to the development of strong, positive bonds with their sibling. In addition, siblings who live apart may have fewer opportunities for conflictual or problematic interactions. As the literature suggests, siblings in care often desire more time with one another (Lundstrom & Sallnas, 2012) . Provided this logic holds, qualitative research may examine how the sibling bond is understood for youth in foster care at different developmental stages; and quantitative research may evaluate the strength of the sibling relationship as youth age and in different living situations, including for siblings who move into separate placements while in foster care.",

Considered in relation to prior experimental studies of sibling interventions with foster youth and other at-risk populations, and taken together with previously published data on the fidelity, feasibility, and youth engagement levels for our specific intervention (Kothari et al., 2014) , the current results suggest that sibling programming may be an important area of development for child welfare practitioners, policymakers, and researchers. Since conflict between siblings is common and often a source of stress for biological and foster families, perhaps caregivers will also see benefits from enrolling youth in a sibling intervention program. Teaching youth prosocial skills and enhancing sibling relationships may also have spillover effects for youths' relationships with peers and other individuals. In addition, providing youth in foster care with opportunities to strengthen their relationship with their sibling(s) may be of interest to program developers, for whom a focus on sibling relationship enhancement may provide a universal and strengths-based approach to supporting the needs and well-being of youth.",
