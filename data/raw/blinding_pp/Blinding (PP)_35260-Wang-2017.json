Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) including both influenza B lineages can improve protection against circulating influenza B viruses. Methods: Participants >/ = 3 years of age were recruited, stratified by age, and then randomly allocated at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive one-injection of the experimental QIV, TIV-Victoria (Vic) or TIV-Yamagata (Yam). The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies induced by the QIV candidate are not inferior to the licensed TIVs. Results: First, 3661 participants received the inoculation. The QIV was found to be non-inferior to TIVs in terms of the geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates (SCRs) of the HI antibodies against shared strains 28 days after completion of inoculation, and was superior to the TIVs against the alternate B strain, which is absent from the TIVs. The occurrences of adverse events (AEs) post-vaccination were similar across the treatment groups. Conclusion: The experimental QIV showed good immunogenicity and an acceptable safety profile.",
