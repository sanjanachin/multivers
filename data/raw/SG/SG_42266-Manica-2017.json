Objective: To determine whether dietary and physical restriction effectively lead to a decrease on postoperative complications of adenotonsillectomy in children when compared to no restriction. Methods: We have designed a randomized clinical trial comparing two intervention: no specific counseling on diet or activity (Group A), and restriction recommendations on diet and physical activities (Group B). Caregivers completed a questionnaire on observed pain, diet and activity patterns, and medications administered. Parameters were compared at the 3rd and at the 7th postoperative day between intervention groups. Results: We have enrolled a total of 95 patients, 50 in Group A and 45 in Group B. Fourteen patients were lost to follow up. Eventually, 41 patients in group A and 40 in Group B were available for final analysis.",

Tonsillectomy may improve QoL by reducing throat infections, health care provider visits, and the need for antibiotic therapy. Similarly, it improves sleep disturbance, vocal quality and cognitive and behavioral impairment in children. 2 Offsetting the benefits of tonsillectomy, surgery complications may include throat pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, delayed feeding, voice changes, hemorrhage, and rarely death. 2 Although it is a traditional surgery, the postoperative recovery period still raises doubts and concerns for patient's caregivers, and is culturally seen as restrictive and temporarily disabling. Socioeconomic impacts related to post adenotonsillectomy recovery are considerable, since it is estimated to last between seven and ten days, resulting in school and work absenteeism. There is great heterogeneity among surgeons on the subject of postoperative recommendations, but studies conducted in US 3, 4 and Europe 5 showed no change in the postoperative outcome of patients advised to restrict the diet and physical activity compared to those with no restrictions.
