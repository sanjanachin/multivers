It was hypothesized that the children in the intervention group would show greater progress in adaptive behavior than the children in the control group. Methods-Assessment of the program efficacy was carried out by comparing children who received services for 6 months and those who did not. Children who were recognized as having developmental delays by teachers in kindergarten programs, and confirmed by trained evaluators based on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II (VABS-II), were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Twenty student teachers were recruited from a teaching university and were provided with pre-program training and ongoing supervision. Results-The outcomes of the program were examined at 0, 3, and 6 months using the VABS-II. The intervention group improved significantly more than the control group in overall adaptive functioning and in the areas of communication, social skills and motor skills. Conclusion-The project is one of only a few early intervention projects to apply randomized control trials in a low-middle-income country. The results demonstrate the feasibility of carrying out the intervention program using teachers with no prior experience of working with children with delays/disabilities, where professional resources are scarce for this population.",

In addition, Goldberg et al. (2009) added two more links, from Motor Skills to Expressive and Personal domains, respectively, to boost model fit. Goldberg et al. reported that the modified factor structure fit the model quite well, with CFI = .97, and RMSEA = .095. Given the modest sample size in each wave of data in the current study, it was not appropriate to conduct CFAs separately. As such, we conducted one CFA on the combined three waves of data.
