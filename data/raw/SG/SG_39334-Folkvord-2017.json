As a consequence, this might lead to a higher intake of energy-dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables, a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases. The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children. We used a randomized between-subject design with 127 children (age: 7-12 y) who played a memory-game, containing either fruit (n = 64) or non-food products (n = 63). While playing the memory-game in a separate room in school during school hours, free intake of fruit (mandarins, apples, bananas, and grapes) was measured. Afterwards, the children completed self-report measures, and length and weight were assessed. The main finding is that playing a memorygame containing fruit increases overall fruit intake (P = 0.016). Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) and mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the nonfood memory-game; no effects were found for apples (P N 0.05) and grapes (P N 0.05). The findings suggest that playing a memory-game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children. This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit, according to international standards, and more traditional health interventions have limited success. Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults, making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way.

        "text": "In general, children do not consume adequate fruit. In the Netherlands, for example, only 5-10% of the children meet the recommended amount of fruit intake (Vandevijvere et al., 2015) . Eating more fruit may improve energy-density and overall diet quality. Fruit and vegetables have low energy-density and are excellent sources of vitamin C, beta-carotene, potassium, and fiber (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM), 2012; Papies, 2016; Wardle et al., 2003) . Several studies have shown that higher fruit consumption is also related to decreased sodium intake, a risk factor for hypertension (Papies, 2016; Wardle et al., 2003 . In contrast, consuming energy-dense snacks activates brain activity in the reward system and stimulates overeating, instead of fulfilling craving (Stice et al., 2009b; Volkow et al., 2008) . Consuming fruits when craving for food can affect body weight successfully, because fruits are high in water and fiber and low in energy-density, and fulfill hunger to a larger extent than energy-dense snacks (Folkvord et al., 2016b; Brownell and Gold, 2013) . Therefore, scholars advise to improve health interventions to increase the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables to children, and reduce access to unhealthy snacks (Eilat-Adar et al., 2011) . Playing simple games that contain fruit might for example be an effective and cheap intervention technique. Moreover, dietary behaviors track into adulthood (Mikkil\u00e4 et al., 2005) and an increase in fruit consumption among young children may decrease future risks of overweight and obesity (Ledoux et al., 2011) and associated chronic diseases (Boeing et al., 2012) . For example, results suggest that children who cope with craving for energydense snacks by eating apples after playing a memory-game with energy-dense food cues, have a lower BMI (Folkvord et al., 2016b) . Although eating behavior among young children is highly correlated with eating behavior at a later age, there has been limited research demonstrating the effectiveness of interventions to increase fruit intake and lower energy-dense dietary patterns among children in this age (Knai et al., 2006) . Therefore, the finding that a simple but enjoyable memorygame increases fruit intake in young children is a promising finding.",
