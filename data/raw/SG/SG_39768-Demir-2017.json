Study design and subjects: In a prospective, randomized study, 72 VLBW infants who had hsPDA received either rectal or oral ibuprofen. The plasma concentration of ibuprofen and renal functions were determined in both groups by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and cystatin-C (cys-C), respectively. Results: The hsPDA closure rate of the group that received rectal ibuprofen was similar to oral ibuprofen (86.1% versus 83.3%) after the first course of the treatment (p \u00bc 0.745). A statistically significant difference was identified between the mean plasma cys-C levels before and after treatment in both the rectal and oral ibuprofen groups (p \u00bc 0.004 and p< 0.001, respectively). The mean plasma ibuprofen concentration was similar in both groups after the first dose (rectal 44.06 \u00b1 12.4; oral, 48.28 \u00b1 22.8) and the third dose (rectal, 45.34 \u00b1 24.3; oral, 48.94 \u00b1 24.8) (p > 0.05 for all values). Conclusions: Rectal ibuprofen is as effective as oral ibuprofen for hsPDA closure in VLBW infants. The rise in the cys-C level with rectal and oral treatment shows that patients with borderline renal function should be evaluated and followed closely.",

We determined that rectal application was as safe as oral treatment in respect to complications after treatment (renal tolerance, gastrointestinal bleeding, NEC, IVH, BPD, and ROP). After many studies demonstrated that oral ibuprofen was as effective and safe as intravenous ibuprofen, the use of its oral form increased globally, especially in developing countries. In many countries, the treatment of newborns intolerant to feeding with PDA with intravenous ibuprofen is a problem as intravenous ibuprofen is rather expensive and hard to acquire. Although many studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral ibuprofen in PDA closure treatment [6, 8, 14, 18, 19] , no study has been conducted on rectal application. The analgesic and antipyretic efficacy of rectal ibuprofen has been demonstrated in previous studies conducted in adults and the pediatric age group. Most of these studies proposed that rectal ibuprofen is a practical and effective method to reach therapeutic plasma levels, especially in the pediatric age group [20] [21] [22] [23] . It is stated that the therapeutic plasma level of ibuprofen starts at levels >10 lg/mL and that its effect increases as this level increases [16, 20, 24] . The pharmacokinetics data of our study are similar to the rectal and oral absorption of ibuprofen reported in the rat study conducted by Hermann et al. [25] . and Kaka et al.
