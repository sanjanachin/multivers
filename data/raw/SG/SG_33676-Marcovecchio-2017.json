We hypothesized that adolescents with high levels of albumin excretion might benefit from angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins, drugs that have not been fully evaluated in adolescents. METHODS We screened 4407 adolescents with type 1 diabetes between the ages of 10 and 16 years of age and identified 1287 with values in the upper third of the albumin-to-creatinine ratios; 443 were randomly assigned in a placebo-controlled trial of an ACE inhibitor and a statin with the use of a 2-by-2 factorial design minimizing differences in baseline characteristics such as age, sex, and duration of diabetes. The primary outcome for both interventions was the change in albumin excretion, assessed according to the albumin-to-creatinine ratio calculated from three early-morning urine samples obtained every 6 months over 2 to 4 years, and expressed as the area under the curve. Key secondary outcomes included the development of microalbuminuria, progression of retinopathy, changes in the glomerular filtration rate, lipid levels, and measures of cardiovascular risk (carotid intima-media thickness and levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and asymmetric dimethylarginine). RESULTS The primary outcome was not affected by ACE inhibitor therapy, statin therapy, or the combination of the two. The use of an ACE inhibitor was associated with a lower incidence of microalbuminuria than the use of placebo; in the context of negative findings for the primary outcome and statistical analysis plan, this lower incidence was not considered significant (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.94). Statin use resulted in significant reductions in total, low-density lipoprotein, and nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, in triglyceride levels, and in the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1, whereas neither drug had significant effects on carotid intima-media thickness, other cardiovascular markers, the glomerular filtration rate, or progression of retinopathy. Overall adherence to the drug regimen was 75%, and serious adverse events were similar across the groups. CONCLUSIONS The use of an ACE inhibitor and a statin did not change the albumin-to-creatinine ratio over time.",

The trial was adequately powered to observe a 25% lower area under the curve of the albuminto-creatinine ratio in the treatment groups than in the placebo groups on the basis of published data from studies involving adolescents. 4 This effect size was conservative, according to previous studies of ACE inhibitors involving adults 11 and a few small studies involving children. [12] [13] [14] However, a subsequent study, the Renin-Angiotensin System Study (RASS), questioned the efficacy of interventions with ACE inhibitors in patients who had normal albumin levels, 23 and the effects of statins on renal function in patients with type 1 diabetes are now less certain. 24 In contrast to the RASS, we observed lower rates of progression to microalbuminuria with the ACE inhibitor than with placebo, and although this finding was not significant, it may be of clinical relevance, since it was related to reduced variability in the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Recent data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the follow-up Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study indicate that even intermittent microalbuminuria may predict cardiovascular risk. 25 As expected, the use of statins significantly reduced lipid levels, and results are consistent with those in a recent small trial assessing the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in improving lipid profiles in 60 adolescents with type 1 diabetes and elevated LDL cholesterol levels. 26 Overall LDL cholesterol levels were lower than those reported in diabetes trials involving adults 27 and in studies involving children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. 28 However, the lipid levels were similar to those in cohorts of adolescents with type 1 diabetes, 7, 29 in which persistently abnormal lipid levels contribute to long-term cardiovascular risk. The use of the ACE inhibitor had little effect on plasma lipid levels, although there were nonsignificantly higher HDL cholesterol levels, as reported previously. 30 Statins were associated with only a small reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, but these levels were within the normal range at baseline. 31 Asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were no different after statin therapy, consistent with previous reports. 32 We selected carotid intima-media thickness as the primary vascular marker in our trial, since it is reproducible, noninvasive, and can offer prognostic information on adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 33 The thickness is higher in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes than in agematched healthy children. 8 However, in contrast to studies involving adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia, carotid intima-media thickness was not affected by the use of statins in our trial. One explanation could be that patients with familial hypercholesterolemia have been exposed to high lipid levels since birth and may have greater arterial-wall thickening than agematched patients with type 1 diabetes. 28, 34 Despite the absence of any response with respect to the carotid intima-media thickness in our trial, long-term follow-up of the cohort will be important to assess whether intervention during this critical period of adolescence will result in a \"legacy effect\" similar to that observed after previous trials investigating glycemic and lipid control. 35, 36 There was no significant effect of the ACE inhibitor on the progression of retinopathy in our trial, in contrast to results from previous studies involving adults who received enalapril. 23 These differences may relate to the relatively early stages of retinopathy in our young population, the duration of treatment, or possibly an ACE-inhibitor class effect. We observed a trend toward lower retinopathy progression with statin treatment, although this was less apparent over time, possibly reflecting lower numbers of patients with data on retinopathy or decreased drug adherence.
