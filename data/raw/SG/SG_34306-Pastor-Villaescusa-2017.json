The objectives were to determine whether oral metformin treatment reduces BMI z score, cardiovascular risk, and inflammation biomarkers in children who are obese depending on pubertal stage and sex. METHODS: This was a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, stratified according to pubertal stage and sex, conducted at 4 Spanish clinical hospitals. Eighty prepubertal and 80 pubertal nondiabetic children who were obese aged 7 to 14 years with a BMI >95th percentiles were recruited. The intervention included 1 g/d of metformin versus placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was a reduction in BMI z score. Secondary outcomes comprised insulin resistance, cardiovascular risk, and inflammation biomarkers. RESULTS: A total of 140 children completed the study (72 boys). Metformin decreased the BMI z score versus placebo in the prepubertal group (\u22120.8 and \u22120.6, respectively; difference, 0.2; P = .04). Significant increments were observed in prepubertal children treated with metformin versus placebo recipients in the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (0.",

        "text": "Overweight and obesity in children are the most challenging health problems to address. 1 Obesity plays an important pathophysiologic role in the development of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a risk of early cardiovascular disease. 2, 3 For pediatric patients, several investigations have confirmed that an intensive lifestyle intervention can increase weight loss and insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing T2DM. 4 Nevertheless, a single-strategy lifestyle intervention is not always effective. 5 In addition, efforts have been made to identify effective and safe drugs to manage pediatric obesity. Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent approved by the US Food Drug Administration to treat T2DM in adults and children aged >10 years; it is considered a first-line agent in T2DM by the European Medicines Agency. Significant weight loss induced by metformin has been shown in adults who are obese with or without T2DM. 6 Metformin also produced a decrease in the cardiovascular risk profile 7 -10 and inflammatory biomarkers. 7 -14 Nevertheless, evidence regarding the effects of metformin in pediatric obesity is scarce. According to a systematic review and metaanalysis, 15 a reduction in BMI due to metformin compared with the effects of lifestyle interventions alone from 6 to 12 months has been reported in children who are obese. Seven studies have evaluated the effects of metformin (1000-2000 mg/d for 3-6 months) on such conditions related to obesity in children and/or adolescents who are obese, 16 -22 with some promising results obtained. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic did not show an adequate and separate distribution in the study design according to prepubertal and pubertal children. Puberty might act as a potential modifier on the effect of metformin in childhood. Thus, it seems useful to stratify randomization according to Tanner stage and sex to avoid large imbalances between groups in linear growth velocity and other factors associated with pubertal maturation that may affect changes in BMI. 5 We therefore designed an RCT to determine whether metformin would have an effect on reducing the BMI z score and improving cardiovascular and inflammatory risk biomarkers in children who are obese and to assess whether this effect differed depending on pubertal stage and sex.",

        "text": "A lack of effect of metformin in the pubertal children who were obese might be related to the lower doses used for these subjects (milligrams of metformin per kilograms of body weight), providing dose-dependent efficacy according to body weight. Reviewing the literature, only Mauras et al 21 divided metformin doses into 1000 mg/d for those aged <12 years and 2000 mg/d for those aged \u22652 years; however, their sample size was small, and no differential responses were observed according to the pubertal stage. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the fact that the failure of a metformin effect in pubertal children could also be due to the physiologic and hormonal changes in that stage. Indeed, puberty is associated with a marked decrease in insulin sensitivity, 33 and an insulin-sensitizing therapy would therefore have to be increased proportionately to observe a similar effect in prepubertal children. Accordingly, future RCTs should consider higher doses of metformin for adolescents to obtain a beneficial effect, taking into account the maximum dosing described for youngsters aged 10 to 16 years (2000 mg/d). 34 Regarding the lipid profiles, no significant changes occurred in any pubertal group. Three studies have shown an improvement in some lipid parameters in pubertal subjects who are obese. 17, 35, 36 However, no changes were observed compared with the placebo intervention by many other studies in patients both prepubertal and pubertal who were obese, 18, 21, 22, 30, 37 nor were there any changes in pubertal population only. 16, 20, 29, 32 Hence, the evidence is still unclear and seems to depend on the presence/absence of dyslipidemia. 38 Furthermore, metformin is considered as an insulin sensitizer, with its pleiotropic actions, and it exerts protective effects on multiple organs, mainly in insulin-targeted tissues such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissues. 39 In the current study, QUICKI, considered for years as an optimal method of determining insulin sensitivity in subjects who are obese, increased only in the prepubertal children. One previous RCT assessed the changes in QUICKI according to a metformin intervention for 6 months in an experimental group comprising both prepubertal and pubertal children who were obese, but no effects were obtained. 22 Moreover, a significant increase has only been shown to date in pubertal children who are obese. 32, 36 A significant improvement in the ALR was observed in the prepubertal children after taking metformin. The ALR is considered a potential surrogate marker for cardiometabolic disease. 40 Similar results have been reported by previous investigators in children 22 and adolescents who are obese. 17, 22 However, we found no effects of metformin on plasma adipokine levels.

There are no studies to date in humans that assessed changes in INF-\u03b3 in subjects who are obese. However, it has been reported that metformin exerted its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory mediators as IFN-\u03b3 both in a macrophage cell line (RAW267.4) and in animal models of multiple sclerosis. 41 This finding may be interesting enough to warrant investigation of other actions of metformin pathways. Similarly, tPAI-1 is a principal physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis and a relevant marker of inflammation and prothrombosis. 42 Thus far, only Mauras et al 21 have evaluated the effects of metformin on tPAI-1 concentrations, and they observed no changes by metformin and no differences according to pubertal stage. The current RCT is the first study to report an influence of metformin on tPAI-1 reduction in pediatric patients who are obese and only in the prepubertal group. CRP was not modified in the current study in either pubertal group after treatment. Different investigators have evaluated this inflammatory biomarker after metformin interventions, but none of them found changes. 16, 19 -22 Another well-known inflammation biomarker, TNF-\u03b1, has been studied only in 2 RCTs similar to ours. 19, 20 Only Evia-Viscarra et al 19 observed changes in the variances of serum TNF-\u03b1 concentration over 3 months in pubertal children who are obese.
