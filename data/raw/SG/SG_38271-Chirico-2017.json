We evaluated whether recorded maternal voices were safe and effective in limiting pain in preterm infants undergoing heel lance procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit of an Italian children's hospital. Methods: This prospective, controlled study took place from December 2013 to December 2015. We enrolled 40 preterm infants, born at a 26-34 weeks of gestation, at a corrected gestational age 29-36 weeks and randomised them to listen or not listen to a recording of their mother's voice during a painful, routine heel lance for blood collection. Changes in the infants' Premature Infant Pain Profile, heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure during the procedure were compared by analysis of variance. Possible side effects, of apnoea, bradycardia, seizures and vomiting, were also recorded. Results: Both groups showed a marked increase in PIPP scores and decrease in oxygen saturation during the procedure, but infants in the treatment group had significantly lower PIPP scores (p = 0.00002) and lower decreases in oxygen saturation (p = 0.0283). No significant side effects were observed. Conclusion: Using recorded maternal voices to limit pain in preterm infants undergoing heel lance procedures appeared safe and effective.",

The volume of the recording was then normalised by a music editing software programme to avoid excessive peaks during the audio playback. The filtered talking or singing was made into a recording, which was repeated to provide 30 minutes of audio content. This recording was then played to the infant through a system called MAMI VOiCE (MAMI VOiCE Association, Lombardy, Italy), which had previously been tested with the use of a certified sound level meter. The purpose was to ensure that, while the system was operating, the 60 dB limit imposed by the CEI 62-22 regulations for neonatal incubators was not exceeded. The tests were performed by placing the vibro transducer in several points above the incubator cover to verify that the variation of the sound spread was more or less constant in terms of dB. When we changed the vibro transducer position, the sound inside the incubator did not undergo any appreciable changes in terms of acoustic performance, with maximum variations of 2 dB. During the performed tests, the excellent performance of the vibro transducer between 50 and 55 dB was verified; while the background noise of the incubator under normal conditions was about 47/48 dB, the MAMI VOiCE system could operate by adding just a few dB. The system consisted of a SolidDrive vibro transducer that uses neodymium to prevent magnetic fields (MSE Audio, Overland Park, KS, USA) placed above, outside and in contact with the incubator, and of a VIBeR amplifier (Rokepo and Bigogno, Lombardy, Italy) to which a universal serial bus pen drive containing the audio file of the recorded voice is connected.
