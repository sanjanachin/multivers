Design: Randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded study. Participants: Children with CP; 10 children each in the control and intervention groups. Intervention: IVG using Wii, given as a supplement to conventional therapy, for 45 min per day, 6 days a week for 3 weeks. The children in the control group received conventional therapy alone. Outcome Measures: Posture control and balance, upper limb function, visual-perceptual skills, and functional mobility. Results: Significant improvement in upper limb functions was seen in the intervention group but not in the control group. Improvements in balance, visual perception, and functional mobility were not significantly different between control and intervention groups. Conclusions: Wii-based IVG may be offered as an effective supplement to conventional therapy in the rehabilitation of children with CP.",

Over the last few years, interactive video gaming (IVG) has emerged as a new modality of rehabilitation for children with CP. 3 The primary purpose of IVG-based therapy in children with CP is to improve competence and confidence in motor activities through engagement in interactive games in a safe and controlled environment. Game-based activities that are naturally interesting to children make it likely that their motivation and compliance to the therapeutic regimen would be high. 4 In addition, these games can be adjusted depending on the player's skill level; when a child's performance improves, the game can be upgraded to the next level of difficulty, thus providing novelty and continuity.",

The variety of stimuli that can be given, the ability to control level of difficulty of the game based on individual requirements and also record the outcomes, help clinicians and therapists to tailor the therapy program to suit each individual child. Children who often do not comply with conventional exercise programs tend to be more motivated to follow exercise programs based on IVG. 25 As has been shown previously, 8 IVG provided as a replacement for conventional therapy did not produce significant changes in functional tasks that assessed balance in children with spastic hemiplegic CP. There is very little information available in literature on the impact of IVG-supplemented therapy compared with conventional therapy alone. This has been addressed in this study by comparing all outcomes in the intervention group (Wii games-supplemented conventional therapy) with those obtained in a control group that received conventional therapy alone. In addition, we considered this to be an appropriate study design since it would be unethical to withhold conventional therapy completely from the children in the intervention group. Improvement in posture control and balance are important goals in the rehabilitation of children with CP. Previous studies have shown that Wii-based therapy resulted in significant improvements in this domain. 11, 12 Ramstrand and Lygneg\u00e5rd 26 conducted a cross-over randomized trial, where children with CP received a 5-week home-based Nintendo Wii Fit-based IVG program and then crossed-over to a 5-week regimen of conventional therapy. Improvement in balance was tested as one of the outcomes tested. The results of this study showed that none of the tests which assessed balance improved significantly with IVGbased therapy. On the other hand, the study conducted by Jelsma et al. 8 on the effect of Nintendo Wii Fit among children with spastic hemiplegic CP showed significant improvement in balance, but the benefits were not reflected in functional tests that assessed balance. A major difference between these two studies 8, 26 and our study was the fact that they used the Nintendo Wii Fit which specifically targets balance improvement, while our study used the Nintendo Wii which emphasizes more on upper body movements and can be played even if the child is unable to stand. Overall, despite differences in study design, the results of the present study, which showed no significant improvement in balance with short-term IVG-supplemented therapy, are in agreement with those of Ramstrand and Lygneg\u00e5rd 26 and Jelsma et al. 8 We speculate that IVG-based therapy for longer durations may have a beneficial effect on balance; however, more research is required to test this hypothesis.",

        "text": "The grasp module of QUEST assesses full-hand prehension and precision handling. Playing the Wii tennis game was expected to improve grasp, especially full-hand prehension, as the child has to hold on to the Wii remote, which is shaped like the handle of a tennis racquet, tightly. A better grasp would allow the child to play a point in the tennis game for a longer duration. In our study, the children played tennis mainly with the dominant hand, although the supervising therapist encouraged them to use the affected upper limb. Most children felt frustrated and got discouraged when they found it difficult to play the games with the affected upper limb. Hence, they were allowed to use the dominant hand while playing tennis. In the boxing game, the child has to hold the Wii remote in one hand and a similarly styled device, called the nunchuck, in the other hand. The child throws punches with both hands, and therefore, grasp in both hands was expected to improve. As mentioned earlier, the sensitivity of the Wii remote was kept at a low level where the child had to make a substantial amount of arm movement in order to play the games. The results of our study showed that upper limb functions (as assessed by QUEST), especially grasp, improved significantly in the group that received Wii-supplemented conventional therapy, but not in the group that received conventional therapy alone. The fact that improvements were seen in upper limb functions (but not in balance) in the intervention group shows that even a short duration of IVG-based therapy using Wii (3 weeks) can have significant beneficial effects in this domain. It is also possible that the nature of the Wii games we have chosen (tennis and boxing) encouraged upper body movement more than lower body movement. This may be the reason for the significant improvement in upper limb function that we have seen. In this context, Chiu et al. 27 in their study showed that a 6-week home-based therapy using Wii Sports Resort tended to improve grip strength and hand function; the changes were however not significant. On the other hand, Winkels et al. 10 showed that twice weekly Wii-based therapy for 6 weeks did not improve grip strength as assessed by QUEST. However, it was noted that there was significant increase in convenience in using the upper limbs for performance of daily activities. Larger studies are required to confirm the possible beneficial effect of IVG on upper limb and hand function.",

            "However, it was noted that there was significant increase in convenience in using the upper limbs for performance of daily activities.",
            "Larger studies are required to confirm the possible beneficial effect of IVG on upper limb and hand function."
