        "text": "Introduction: Motor impairment in children with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP) is generally more prominent in the affected upper limb, leading to limitations in hand function stemming from deficiencies in motor coordination and selective motor control as well as muscle weakness, slower execution of movements and deficient integration of sensory-motor information. Objective: Determine the effect of a single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with functional training on the spatiotemporal variables of upper arm movements in children with spastic hemiparesis. Method: A randomized, sham-controlled trial with a blinded evaluator was conducted involving 20 children with CP between 6 and 12 years of age. The spatiotemporal variables of the upper limbs were analyzed by comparing the results of Evaluation 1 (before stimulation) and Evaluation 2 (immediately after stimulation). The protocol consisted of a 20-minute session of functional training of the paretic upper limb combined with tDCS administered over the primary motor cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the motor impairment at an intensity of 1 mA. The participants were randomly allocated to two groups: experimental group (anodal tDCS) and control group (sham tDCS). Results: Statistically significant (p < 0.05) reductions in total movement duration and returning movement duration were found in both the paretic and non-paretic limbs in the group submitted to active tDCS. No significant differences were found in the control group for any of the variables analyzed. Conclusion: A single session of anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the brain lesion led to momentary motor improvements in both upper limbs of the children with spastic hemiparetic CP analyzed in the present study.",

However, no consensus is found on studies conducted with stroke survivors regarding the ideal electrode montage to obtain motor improvements in the paretic upper limb. The literature offers contradictory data regarding the administration of anodal stimulation ipsilateral to the brain lesion, cathodal stimulation contralateral to the lesion and the combined use of anodal stimulation ipsilateral and cathodal stimulation contralateral to the lesion. The variety of electrode montages in individuals with hemiparesis is explained by the fact that the researchers employed tDCS as a means to diminish the imbalance in bilateral brain activity in an attempt to minimize maladaptive neuroplastic changes secondary to a unilateral lesion. A limitation of the present study is related to the analysis of the effects of a single electrode montage. It is therefore not possible to state whether the reduction in total movement duration would be different with the use of cathodal stimulation contralateral to the lesion or the combination of anodal stimulation ipsilateral and cathodal stimulation contralateral to the lesion. Moreover, future studies should involve a greater number of neurophysiologic and motor variables to investigate the motor changes caused by stimulation that resulted in the reduction of the total duration of the movement investigated to enable the understanding of the effects of tDCS on paretic and non-paretic upper limb function in a more specific, detailed fashion.",

However, the few studies that have addressed the use of tDCS in this pediatric population agree that the technique is safe and offers minimal adverse effects. Indeed, no adverse effects were observed during the procedures of the present study, which therefore contributes to findings described in the literature. Questions remain regarding the ideal current for use on children, but 0.7-1.0 mA seems to be safe for this purpose. 19, 40 Despite the preliminary nature of the present findings with regard to the possibility of using tDCS in children with CP, the results are promising. The main limitations of this study were the small number of participants, the lack of an adequate sample size calculation and the fact that only one post-intervention evaluation was performed. As the post-intervention evaluation was performed immediately following stimulation, it is not possible to determine whether the reductions in total movement duration and returning movement duration would be maintained for a longer period of time. However, the findings demonstrate that tDCS resulted in motor changes, whereas sham tDCS did not. The variables analyzed also do not allow the determination of the reason for the improvement in both the paretic and non-paretic upper limbs. However, future studies that involve neurophysiologic evaluations could explain this finding.",
