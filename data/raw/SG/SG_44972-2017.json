Total 80 cases of neonates with severe birth asphyxia were included in the study. Cases selection was done with the help of a pre defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Neonates were randomly divided into two groups, each group having 40 neonates. Out of 80 patients 51(66.67%) were male while 29(33.33%) were female..Both groups had more male cases than female, The mean gestational age of the patient was 38.32wk with standard deviation 1.29 although the min age was 37 wk and max age was 41wk, The mean Plasma creatinine (mg/dL) day 1 presentation in treatment group was 92\u00b122, in placebo group was 1.99\u00b1.21.

Efficacy of theophylline in preventing kidney dysfunction in severe birth asphyxia and improving renal outcome at 5 th day was found to be higher of life for term neonates as 63.6% vs. 48.5 Conclusions: Theophylline, given early after birth, has beneficial effects on reducing renal dysfunction in neonates with severe birth asphyxia",
