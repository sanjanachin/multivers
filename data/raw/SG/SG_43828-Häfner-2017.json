        "text": "Despite these important findings, there is a lack of knowledge about potential remedies. One arguably promising avenue is the use of motivational interventions. Several recent studies indicate that relevance interventions can successfully promote student motivation by raising students' perceptions of the usefulness of a task or subject (Hulleman, Godes, Hendricks, & Harackiewicz, 2010; Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009) . It remains unclear, however, whether these interventions are also a good means to decrease motivational gaps between students from families with more motivational resources and those from families with fewer resources. On the one hand, students with better initial conditions might benefit more strongly from relevance interventions, due to their initial advantage in motivational resources (e.g., Durik, Hulleman, & Harackiewicz, 2015) , thereby increasing gaps between over-and underprivileged students (Ceci & Papierno, 2005) . This phenomenon is also known as the Matthew effect (Walberg & Tsai, 1983 ; the Bible states, \"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance . . .\" [Matthew 13:12, King James version] ). On the other hand, Harackiewicz, Tibbetts, Canning, and Hyde (2014) recently argued that relevance interventions might be especially effective for students growing up in families with fewer resources (see also Harackiewicz, Canning, Tibbetts, Priniski, & Hyde, 2016) , a phenomenon that we call the Robin Hood effect. Just as Robin Hood gave resources to the ones in need, relevance interventions might pass on important utility information to students in need-students from families with fewer motivational resources. Moreover, if relevance interventions create Robin Hood effects, it remains unclear if they occur immediately or over time. Students from families with low motivational resources might receive new utility information during the intervention. These students might process this utility information more deeply and look for the relevance of math in their everyday life, leading to cascading effects of the intervention on their utility value beliefs over time. Thus, sleeper effects (responses that may not surface for several weeks or months; Kagan & Moss, 1962) might occur because of small changes in the beginning leading to recursive intervention effects over time for students with lower resources (Cohen et al., 2009) .",

        "text": "The aim of the present study was, thus, to investigate whether the effects of two relevance intervention conditions (either writing a text or evaluating interview quotations) differed depending on students' family background (both SES and motivational family resources) producing either a Matthew effect or a Robin Hood effect. We used data from the Motivation in Mathematics (MoMa) study, in which two relevance interventions were implemented in a cluster randomized controlled study design with 82 German ninth grade math classrooms. Prior analyses have shown these relevance interventions to improve students' motivational beliefs (Brisson et al., in press; Gaspard, Dicke, Flunger, Brisson, et al., 2015) . Extending these findings, we examined differential effects of these two relevance interventions on a variety of students' motivational outcomes depending on parent-reported structural and motivational family resources. More specifically, we investigated effects 6 weeks and 5 months after the relevance interven-tions had taken place, which allowed us to differentiate between short-term effects and potential sleeper effects (Kagan & Moss, 1962) . Coleman et al. (1966) concluded that the most crucial factor for students to be successful in school was family background. Although more recent research also highlights the powerful effects of various factors at the school, classroom, and teacher level (Hattie, 2009) , an overwhelming number of studies have demonstrated the importance of family background for students' academic outcomes (see meta-analysis by Sirin, 2005) . Most studies investigating the effects of students' family background focused on so-called structural family resources (e.g., SES) that characterize a family's economic and social position within societal structures and are associated with students' academic outcomes (see Sirin, 2005) . Students from families with a lower SES tend to live in less motivating and cognitively activating environments and, thus, have been found to show lower academic motivation and achievement (e.g., Dumont et al., 2012; Dumont, Trautwein, Nagy, & Nagengast, 2014; McLoyd, 1998; Sirin, 2005; Steinmayr et al., 2012) . In addition to structural family resources, recent research has identified motivational family resources as one important factor. For instance, motivational beliefs within a family have been shown to shape students' academic outcomes (Eccles, 2007; Grolnick et al., 2009) . Compared with structural family resources such as SES, motivational beliefs within a family are more proximal to the child and directly influence the processes within a family (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) . As motivational beliefs within a family shape students' environment more directly, they might be even more important for students' academic outcomes than SES (Dumont et al., 2012; Grolnick et al., 2009; H\u00e4fner, Flunger, et al., 2017) . Eccles et al. (1983) expectancy-value theory (EVT) and more specifically, the parent socialization model (Eccles, 2007; Jacobs & Eccles, 2000) embedded within EVT, suggest that parents act as role models and thus pass on their own motivational beliefs to their children (Jacobs & Eccles, 2000) .",

Compared with intrinsic and attainment value, utility value is more extrinsic in nature. Because the utility value of a task relates to future goals, the task itself is not necessarily valued for its own sake . Thus, utility value beliefs can be influenced through interventions by highlighting the relevance of a subject for possible future careers, occupations, and everyday life (e.g., Woolley, Rose, Orthner, Akos, & Jones-Sanpei, 2013) . Several studies demonstrated the success of interventions promoting students' utility value beliefs in enhancing students' self-concept, interest, effort, and achievement in psychology, mathematics, and science (Brisson et al., in press; Durik & Harackiewicz, 2007; Gaspard, Dicke, Flunger, Brisson, et al., 2015; Hulleman et al., 2010; Woolley et al., 2013) .

The present study investigates whether the effects of these two relevance interventions on students' motivation in math were moderated by family background. In detail, we investigated parent-reported FI and parental utility values as moderators next to SES, because prior research has shown that these indicators are highly relevant for students' motivation. In addition, students whose parents hold low utility beliefs might profit most from the intervention, as these students might receive new utility information during the intervention, which they did not receive from their parents. Thus, we chose parents' utility value beliefs as a potential moderator. Several crucial motivational variables including students' value beliefs, selfconcept, and effort were assessed to get a comprehensive picture of the impact of the intervention conditions on students' motivation. We chose mathematics as the target subject because student motivation in mathematics declines dramatically during secondary school (Jacobs et al., 2002; Watt, 2004) . At the same time, math is an important prerequisite for STEM careers (National Science Board, 2007) . We had three major research questions. First, we analyzed whether the effects of the relevance intervention conditions were moderated by family motivational resources. More specifically, is there empirical support for a \"no differential effects\" perspective, for Matthew effects (i.e., already privileged students profit most; Walberg & Tsai, 1983) , or for Robin Hood effects (i.e., students from families with low motivational resources profit most)?

Students absent during the intervention were not included in the present analyses (N \u03ed 65). Students were enrolled in 82 classrooms from 25 schools. Teachers and their classes were randomly assigned within each school to the waiting control group or one of two intervention conditions (text and quotations condition) resulting in 27 classes in the control condition, 30 classes in the text condition, and 25 classes in the quotations condition. It was ensured that all classes taught by the same teacher were in the same experimental condition and that conditions were distributed equally within each school. The majority of parents from participating students responded to the parent questionnaire (79.5%). We asked the parent most involved in each student's homework to fill out the parent questionnaire: 56.3% of the questionnaires were filled out by students' mothers, 23.6% by mothers and fathers together, and 16.7% by fathers (0.4% were filled out by a different person). Because data were collected from the highest educational track in Germany, parents' educational level was above the national average, with 56.4% of mothers and 66.9% of fathers holding qualifications for college education (i.e., obtained a university of applied sciences entrance qualification or the Abitur certificate). However, with about 40% of all students attending elementary school going on to academic track schools in Germany (Statistisches Bundesamt [Federal Office of Statistics], 2016), this school track has the highest heterogeneity in terms of students' socioeconomic background (Trautwein & Neumann, 2008) . Accordingly, the present sample comprised students with parents from a broad range of educational backgrounds: 56.4% of mothers and 66.9% of fathers had qualifications for college education (university of applied sciences entrance qualification or the Abitur certificate, equivalent to 13 years of school), 35.4% of mothers and 18.5% of fathers had graduated from the intermediate track schools (equivalent to 10 years of school), and 6.8% of mothers and 11.8% of fathers had graduated from the lowest track schools or did not graduate at all (equivalent to 9 years of school or less). Concerning our SES measure (the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status; Ganzeboom & Treiman, 2003) , we also found a substantial amount of variance in the sample under investigation (Range ISEI \u03ed 16 to 90; x \u03ed 65.24, SD \u03ed 16.21).

To estimate the effects of the intervention more precisely, all models included students' respective motivational indicator at the pretest as a covariate at the student level and at the class level (Raudenbush, 1997) . These effects were freely estimated at both levels to account for contextual effects (Korendijk, Hox, Moerbeek, & Maas, 2011; Marsh et al., 2009) . In addition, an indicator of students' migration background was included as a predictor on both levels to control for students' migration background with effects on both levels being freely estimated. Furthermore, we included the respective indicator of family background as a predictor on both levels.

In addition, it is common to find lower effect sizes of interventions in natural settings compared with laboratory interventions (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) . Although reported effect sizes might seem rather small, seemingly small effects are meaningful in the educational setting. As is shown in Figure 1 , both intervention conditions resulted in similar levels of students' utility and attainment value beliefs, and effort for students from families with FI one standard deviation above and below the mean-thereby compensating the motivational gaps. Moreover, simple slope analyses indicated that the text condition resulted in an increase of .29 standard deviation of utility value beliefs and the quotation condition in an increase of .37 standard deviation for students from families with FI one standard deviation below the mean.

Simple slopes analyses revealed no considerable negative effects of the intervention for students with higher levels of FI and parents' math utility values. Just as Robin Hood wanted to help the less privileged by providing them with resources they did not have, we expected to foster academic motivation for students in need by giving relevant utility information to them. Students whose families have high motivational resources (e.g., high value beliefs) have higher levels of academic motivation themselves (Frenzel et al., 2010; Rozek et al., 2015) . By providing some of the resources available to students whose families have high motivational resources within our intervention, students from families who did not already hold these motivational resources profited most from the intervention. At the same time, we did not find any considerable adverse effects for students from families with higher motivational resources. However, some would argue that students from families with high motivational resources had to attend the intervention of 90 minutes, but did not profit as much as their counterparts. Nevertheless, all students actually profited from the intervention in terms of their utility value beliefs-with students from families with high math interest simply profiting less. Considering the positive associations of students' utility value beliefs with students' academic outcomes and choices (Harackiewicz et al., 2014) , the 90-minutes intervention appears worthwhile for all students. Additionally, relevance interventions might be a promising tool to establish similar initial conditions for students from families with distinct levels of FI.",

One reason might be that the sample under investigation was comprised solely of academic track students, which were positively selective in terms of SES. However, this student population has the highest heterogeneity in terms of SES in Germany (Trautwein & Neumann, 2008) . Academic track students from relatively low SES families have worse educational outcomes compared with academic track students from relatively high SES families: They perform worse in achievement tests (Ehmke, Hohensee, Heidemeier, & Prenzel, 2004) , are at higher risk of dropping out of the academic track (Hillmert & Jacob, 2010; Stamm, 2010) , and have a lower probability of attending a university after graduating from high school (Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung, 2012; Hillmert & Jacob, 2005 , 2010 Kramer et al., 2011) . Thus, students' SES still plays an important role in academic track schools in Germany, particularly concerning students' achievement, transitions, and dropout. However, regarding student motivation, our results suggest that motivational family resources are more important for the development of students' motivational beliefs (correlations between motivational family resources and students' motivational beliefs ranged from .09 \u0545 r \u0545 .35) than structural family characteristics such as SES. In fact, the correlations between SES and students' motivational beliefs varied in direction and were small in magnitude (\u03ea.13 \u0545 r \u0545 .11).

Yet, the intervention effects for students from families with low motivational resources increased even until follow-up, in contrast to their counterparts. One possible explanation of the sleeper effects found could be different forms of information processing for students from families with more motivational family resources (for whom the utility information might have been familiar) and students from families with less motivational resources (for whom the utility information might have been new). Thus, students whose parents reported lower levels of math interest might have reflected more about the content of the intervention, namely the usefulness of math, andover time-realized and adopted the usefulness of math more and more (e.g., Berlyne, 1960; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) . Similarly, Mitchell (1993) considered stimulation and empowerment as the key incentives for the consolidation of interest (Mitchell, 1993) , which could also be relevant for the consolidation of other motivational processes.
