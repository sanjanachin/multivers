        "text": "BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene that lead to progressive respiratory decline. Some mutant CFTR proteins show residual function and respond to the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in vitro, whereas ivacaftor alone does not restore activity to Phe508del mutant CFTR. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3, crossover trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor, a CFTR corrector, in 248 patients 12 years of age or older who had cystic fibrosis and were heterozygous for the Phe508del mutation and a CFTR mutation associated with residual CFTR function. Patients were randomly assigned to one of six sequences, each involving two 8-week intervention periods separated by an 8-week washout period. They received tezacaftor-ivacaftor, ivacaftor monotherapy, or placebo. The primary end point was the absolute change in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) from the baseline value to the average of the week 4 and week 8 measurements in each intervention period. RESULTS The number of analyzed intervention periods was 162 for tezacaftor-ivacaftor, 157 for ivacaftor alone, and 162 for placebo. The least-squares mean difference versus placebo with respect to the absolute change in the percentage of predicted FEV 1 was 6.8 percentage points for tezacaftor-ivacaftor and 4.7 percentage points for ivacaftor alone (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Scores on the respiratory domain of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised, a quality-of-life measure, also significantly favored the active-treatment groups. The incidence of adverse events was similar across intervention groups; most events were mild or moderate in severity, with no discontinuations of the trial regimen due to adverse events for tezacaftorivacaftor and few for ivacaftor alone (1% of patients) and placebo (<1%). CONCLUSIONS CFTR modulator therapy with tezacaftor-ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone was efficacious in patients with cystic fibrosis who were heterozygous for the Phe508del deletion and a CFTR residual-function mutation.

        "text": "ystic fibrosis is a progressive, systemic, life-limiting, autosomal recessive disease that is caused by reduced quantity or function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. 1, 2 Loss of chloride transport activity due to defects in CFTR results in the accumulation of inspissated mucus in the airways, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 1, 2 More than 270 CFTR mutations are known to cause cystic fibrosis. 3 Disease severity and the rate of disease progression vary with mutation and are determined in part by the extent of chloride transport loss associated with each. A substantial minority of CFTR mutations, affecting approximately 5% of the overall population with cystic fibrosis, exhibit residual CFTR ion transport due to partially retained CFTR expression and variably preserved channel gating or function. [4] [5] [6] These \"residual function\" mutations cause cystic fibrosis with lung disease and a markedly reduced life expectancy, but the disease generally progresses more slowly than more common forms of cystic fibrosis. 7 Without the use of newborn screening, patients with cystic fibrosis that is caused by these mutations often receive a diagnosis after early infancy and are more likely to have pancreatic sufficiency and sweat chloride concentrations below 90 mmol per liter, indicating partially preserved CFTR activity. 4, 8, 9 In contrast, the common Phe508del CFTR mutation, which results in cellular degradation of the protein and causes severe dysfunction when homozygous, leads to early onset of cystic fibrosis and more rapid disease progression. 7 Two complementary types of drugs have been developed with different mechanisms of action to increase CFTR-mediated anion secretion. 10 CFTR potentiators, such as ivacaftor, increase the probability of CFTR channel opening at the cell surface to enhance ion transport and are efficacious in treating gating mutations. [11] [12] [13] CFTR correctors improve the cellular processing and trafficking of normal and mutated CFTR protein to increase the amount of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Ivacaftor-responsive CFTR mutations were identified on the basis of a clinical phenotype of residual CFTR function (which indicates the presence of functional CFTR protein on the cell surface), in vitro data, and clinical case reports. 14, 15 The ad-dition of the CFTR corrector tezacaftor was hypothesized to enhance clinical benefit in patients with these mutations by increasing overall CFTR function; this combination treatment is particularly important for restoring activity to those carrying two copies of the Phe508del CFTR mutation, as shown for the approved corrector-potentiator combination lumacaftor-ivacaftor, and may provide benefit to patients with other CFTR mutations. 6, [16] [17] [18] [19] Tezacaftor is an investigational CFTR corrector that, in combination with ivacaftor, has been shown to improve lung function and decrease sweat chloride concentrations in a phase 2 clinical trial involving patients who were homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and patients who were heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and the G551D CFTR mutation. 20 We hypothesized that this combination would also be beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis caused by the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a residualfunction mutation.",

The primary efficacy analysis, evaluation of the absolute change in the percentage of predicted FEV 1 from the baseline value to the average of the week 4 and week 8 measurements in the tezacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo groups and in the ivacaftor monotherapy and placebo groups, was based on a mixed-effects model. The fixed effects in the model were intervention, intervention period, and percentage of predicted FEV 1 at baseline, with patient as a random effect. Statistical analyses of all secondary end points were similar to that of the analysis of the primary efficacy end point (defined further in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). The type I error rate for comparisons of the active treatments with placebo for the primary end point and key secondary end point was controlled by prespecifying a gatekeeping approach. All safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of the trial regimen, and all were based on data associated with each safety period, which extended from the first dose of the trial regimen in the intervention period to the safety evaluation visit or safety follow-up visit, or to 28 days after the last dose in the intervention period for patients who did not have a safety evaluation visit or safety follow-up visit. The proposed sample size provided the trial with approximately 90% power for a significant difference to be observed between tezacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo for the primary end point. A carryover effect was not expected; therefore, the choice of a crossover design, the evaluation of efficacy by assessment of the change from trial baseline, and the proposed analysis methods were considered to be appropriate.",

Tezacaftor is a broad-acting CFTR corrector that facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of normal CFTR and multiple mutant CFTR forms, including the common Phe508del form, thereby increasing the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface and resulting in increased chloride transport. Results showed important clinical benefit with both combination tezacaftor-ivacaftor treatment and treatment with ivacaftor alone. These findings confirm the benefits of potentiator therapy in patients with residual CFTR function mutations and the added benefit conferred by corrector-potentiator combination therapy in this population. The benefit with respect to spirometric measurements that was observed with tezacaftor-ivacaftor -and, to a lesser extent, with ivacaftor alone -was notable. Differences versus placebo were rapid in onset and were sustained at all trial visits, similar to those in other trials of effective CFTR modulators. 12, 15, 17, [24] [25] [26] Furthermore, differences versus placebo were consistent across all prespecified subgroup analyses.",
