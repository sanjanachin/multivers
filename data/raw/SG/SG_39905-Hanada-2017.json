After venipuncture, the needle and catheter are further advanced within the vessel lumen under real-time ultrasound guidance with constant visualisation of the needle tip in the short-axis view. This can minimise the risk of transfixing the cannulated vessel. We compared two techniques for non-visible saphenous vein cannulation under general anaesthesia in children weighing \u2265 3 kg and less than four years of age: dynamic ultrasound-guided short-axis needle tip navigation technique (ultrasound group) vs. landmark technique. Venous cannulation was performed by three experienced anaesthetists. The primary outcome measure was first-attempt success rate. Success rate within 10 min was a secondary outcome. A total of 102 patients were randomly allocated to either the ultrasound group or the landmark group. First-attempt success rate was 90% in the ultrasound group compared with 51% in the landmark group, p<0.001, difference 39%, 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference 23-55%. Success rate within 10 min was 92% in the ultrasound group compared with 63% in the landmark group, p = 0.001, difference 29%, 95%CI of the difference 14-45%. We conclude that, when performed by experienced anaesthetists, the dynamic ultrasound-guided short-axis needle tip navigation technique improved non-visible saphenous vein cannulation in children compared with the landmark technique.",

        "text": "Ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation has recently gained popularity for use in both adults and children, and a variety of techniques have been described, such as single-operator vs. dual-operator, static vs. dynamic technique and short-axis vs. long-axis approach [1] [2] [3] . The single-operator, dynamic short-axis technique is a common ultrasound-guided technique for vascular access [4] , and allows the operator to precisely locate the needle tip and target vessel while assisting with vessel puncture. However, once the needle tip enters the vessel lumen in the short-axis (out-of-plane) view, the ultrasound image is no longer used and the operator blindly advances the needle. This risks cannulation failure due to accidental transfixion of the target vessel. The dynamic short-axis technique has been modified in order to maximise the chance of successful cannulation. In the modified technique, once the target vessel is punctured, ultrasound is further utilised to guide needle and cannula advancement. The cannula needle is further advanced in a stepwise fashion with constant needle tip visualisation in the short-axis view, whereas the ultrasound probe is concomitantly moved in the direction of needle advancement (Fig. 1) . This minimises the risk of transfixing the posterior wall of the vessel (see Supporting Information online, Video Clip S1).",

Univariate and multivariable results are presented in Table 2 .
