Method: Participants (N = 90) were randomized to Omega-3/6, long-acting MPH, or combination for 12 months. ADHD symptoms were assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale. Results: ADHD symptoms decreased in all treatment arms. Although significant differences favoring Omega + MPH over Omega-3/6 alone were found for ADHD Total and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity subscales, results on the Inattention subscale were similar. CGI-S scores decreased slowly and consistently with Omega-3/6, compared with a rapid decrease and subsequent slight increase in the MPH-containing arms. Adverse events were numerically less frequent with Omega-3/6 or MPH + Omega-3/6 than MPH alone. Conclusion: The tested combination of Omega-3/6 fatty acids had similar effects to MPH, whereas the MPH + Omega combination appeared to have some tolerability benefits over MPH.",

(2008) also used the ADHD Rating Scale in a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of atomoxetine and MPH, with similar mean total scores at baseline and a similar change from baseline to follow-up in the MPH-treated group; however, the SDs were half of those reported in this study. Therefore, the high effect sizes in the present study result from the fact that effects are not controlled for placebo effects and that the sample was very homogenous regarding ADHD scores, as shown by the small SDs. Nevertheless, the suggestion that Omega-3/6 may be as effective as MPH is surprising and needs further replication in blinded randomized controlled trials. Multimodal treatment of ADHD was previously investigated in the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA), in which pharmacological treatment was compared with an intensive behavioral intervention, a combination of pharmacological and behavioral treatment, and standard community care (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999) . The initial results showed that the medication regimen was superior to behavioral therapy and community care, with no significant benefit from the combination of medication and behavioral therapy, although there were small advantages for combination therapy on non-ADHD symptom and positive functioning. Notably, patients receiving combination therapy required lower doses of MPH, consistent with our results. It should be noted, however, that patients in the MTA study had a lower baseline ADHD severity than those in the present study. Subsequent analysis of the MTA dataset using a single outcome score, however, revealed that combination therapy was significantly superior to the other treatment arms, effect sizes ranging from small (0.28 vs. medication only) to moderate (0.70 vs. community treatment; Conners et al., 2001) . Similarly, development of a categorical outcome measure revealed a small but statistically significant benefit of combination treatment over medication alone (Swanson et al., 2001) . Multimodal therapy in which standard medication with MPH is supplemented by nonpharmacological modalities therefore has considerable potential for the treatment of ADHD.",

Limitations of the study include a possible lack of statistical power as a result of the exploratory nature of the study, with no formal sample-size calculation resulting in a small sample size, especially for a noninferiority study; the nonblinded trial design; the lack of a placebo arm; and the high baseline disease severity. The latter can be explained by the nature of the study center, which is a tertiary institution that receives a large number of patients with severe ADHD from other centers. Therefore, we cannot rule out placebo effect, regression to the mean, or that this was the natural symptom course. It should also be noted that the maximum permitted MPH dose of 1 mg/kg may have resulted in low dosing for some patients. In the analysis, the CGI-S score is presented in a somewhat unorthodox way because it was rated by (unblinded) clinicians and parents at each assessment point.",
