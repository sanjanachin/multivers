Successful desensitization has been demonstrated for a number of foods including peanut, milk and egg. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Gradual exposure to increasing amounts of allergen can lead to the majority of subjects tolerating doses of food sufficient to prevent reaction upon accidental exposure. Unfortunately, most subjects undergoing OIT experience allergic reactions during desensitization with approximately 20% having severe reactions requiring injection of epinephrine and another 10-20% of patients being refractory to oral desensitization. [18] [19] [20] Furthermore, desensitization is less likely to be successful in patients with higher baseline food-specific IgE levels, 10, 21 resulting in an increased risk of anaphylaxis with desensitization relative to continued avoidance. 20 While OIT allows some desensitized patients to develop sustained unresponsiveness, defined as persistence of protection after discontinuation of OIT, this occurrs in a small fraction of desensitized patients, generally those lower baseline food specific IgE levels. 21, 22 Lastly, current food allergy OIT clinical studies are hampered by drop-out rates of up to 25% due to reactions and non-compliance over the long periods of desensitization (2-4 years). 23 Recently, omalizumab (Xolair, Genentech South San Francisco), a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, has been used to decrease reactions during oral desensitization. This medicine, initially approved for the treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents, binds free IgE and prevents allergic reactions. 24 We and others have reported in three open-label studies that omalizumab facilitates oral desensitization, in particular allowing more rapid and successful escalation of allergen dosing in subjects with high-risk food allergy. [25] [26] [27] Furthermore, preliminary data suggests that interrupting IgE signaling during oral immunotherapy/antigen exposure may reverse established allergy through induction of both Th1 and regulatory T cells that inhibit the allergic response.

In this study, 71.4% of placebo treated subjects (and 89% of omalizumab treated subjects) passed the final 10,000 mg oral food challenge, consistent with previous studies showing that slow, persistent OIT updosing without omalizumab can be successful. Successful treatment at Month 32 in this study was associated with lower milk-specific IgE levels (median 24 kUa/L), as has been previously suggested. 10 Our study included patients with high peanut specific IgE levels (median 91 kUa/L) who may be at increased risk of having difficulty with conventional immunotherapy. 21, 23, 34, [42] [43] [44] [45] The use of omalizumab allowed rapid desensitization to 2000 mg of peanut protein with low rates of peanut reactions and adverse effects. Although the reaction rates were not statistically lower with omalizumab (7.8% of doses) compared to placebo (16.8%), omalizumab treated subjects were exposed to much higher doses of peanut protein. For example, during the initial rapid desensitization day, grade 2 reactions were observed in 4 of 27 omalizumab treated subjects versus 6 of 8 placebo treated subjects, but omalizumab treated subjects reached a median dose of 250 mg peanut protein compared to 22.5 mg for placebo. The safety of omalizumab in facilitating OIT therefore may be underestimated because of the study design.
