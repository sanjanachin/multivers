Sixty district clusters were randomized to receive iodized salt early at their markets with assistance from regular salt distributors or later as introduced by market forces. At pre-and post-iodization, 1602 children were given cognitive/language tests (namely School Readiness, WPPSI verbal reasoning, WPPSI Matrix reasoning), and mothers were interviewed concerning demographics, nutrition and health. Children's weight, height, urine and a blood sample were taken. Analyses of covariance, adjusting for clustering and baseline levels were conducted. Urinary iodine concentrations were significantly higher at endline in the intervention children than controls though both medians were above threshold. Overall, less than 5% were anemic. There were no significant main effect differences between groups on the cognitive/language tests, but there were effect modifiers, namely mother's education, child's sex and diet. For example, the intervention group performed better on the school readiness test than controls if their mothers had attended school, but not otherwise. In conclusion, the data are consistent with negative findings from studies where children 6 to 12 years were supplemented with an iodine capsule, indicating that the benefits of iodine, in salt or capsule form, for brain development may be restricted to children under 3 years. Yet, benefits may be tied to those with more educational resources or may compensate for conditions of disadvantage.",

From a nutrition perspective, iodine deficiency is regarded as the most common cause of preventable cognitive impairment worldwide (World Health Organization 2014; Zimmermann et al. 2008) . National estimates of iodine deficiency, based on urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) of school-aged children from 2011, show that 30% of the world's population are iodine deficient (UIC < 100 \u03bcg/L), and 5.2% are severely deficient (UIC < 20 \u03bcg/L) (Andersson et al. 2012) . Among the 10 African countries showing high levels of iodine deficiency, Ethiopia ranks first. A recent national survey of households in Ethiopia with a sample size of 10 965 children aged 6 to 12 years confirmed the seriousness of the problem: the median urinary iodine concentration was 24.5 \u03bcg/L, with 45.8% of the sample being severely deficient (Abuye et al. 2007) . Whereas urine concentrations reveal recent intake of iodine, the presence of goiter reveals longer-term deficiencies in intake; the goiter rate was 39.9%. Worldwide, the number of countries with iodine deficiencies has been declining as countries adopt universal salt iodization strategy. The objective of the current study was to use a randomized design to examine the effect of iodized salt on children's mental development in northern Ethiopia.",

        "text": "There is a general understanding that iodine in the form of two thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine, is important in early brain development (Delange 1994) . Not only does it regulate the timing of differentiation of neural tissue in the brain during the fetal stage, but iodine continues postnatally to determine the number of glial cells produced in preparation for the creation of a myelin sheath that coats neural axons in the brain (Bernal et al. 2003 ). Yet careful scrutiny of the research raises questions about the timing of effects of iodine supplementation on mental development in iodine-deficient children (Melse-Boonstra & Jaiswal 2010; Zimmermann et al. 2008) . According to a recent meta-analysis, an effect size of d = 0.48 showed a moderate effect on the cognitive development of children under 3 years following iodine supplementation of their mothers during pregnancy (Bougma et al. 2013) . This is sometimes translated into half a standard deviation difference on a test of intelligence, meaning 7.0 IQ points. Randomized control trials (RCT) with school children aged 6 to 12 years are mainly non-significant. Eight trials (Bautista et al. 1982; Connolly et al. 1979; Gordon et al. 2009; Huda et al. 2001; Solon et al. 2003; Untoro et al. 1999; van den Briel et al. 2000; Zimmermann et al. 2006) , conducted mainly in low-and middle-income countries, supplemented children with a single high dose (400-800 mg) of iodine and measured cognitive development up to 6 months later. On verbal, nonverbal and speed of processing tests, the performance of iodine-supplemented children surpassed controls on only 8 out of 32 outcomes. Thus the effects of iodine found in the early years appear to be diminished in school-aged children. Little is known about the effects of iodine supplements for children between birth and 6 years, especially after 24 months when myelination is largely complete. Although axons and synapses are being pruned for lack of use during these years, remaining axons continue to receive thicker myelin for many years particularly in brain regions underlying language and numeracy (Bernal et al. 2003; Zoeller & Rovet 2004) . It is important to determine whether the window for iodine benefits extends to the preschool years.",

        "text": "The strengths of the study include a randomized design, a large sample that is fairly representative of a region in northern Ethiopia, age-appropriate measures that cover cognitive and language development, and analysis of the effects of exposure to iodized salt rather than a high-dose capsule. Exposure to a high dose of iodine in the form of a capsule permits an individual randomized controlled design but does not reflect how children will be receiving iodine on a regular basis. Earlier reviews have almost certainly over-estimated the effects of iodine supplements on children and adults (effect size 0.9) because of the inadequate designs and measures used by researchers at that time (Bleichrodt & Born 1994) . While there is some evidence that iodine supplements in the fetal or infancy stages are effective at supporting moderate cognitive gains (Bougma et al. 2013) , there is at best mixed evidence for older children. Despite these strengths, there are a number of limitations. One is that both groups of children were receiving iodized salt at the endline and had been receiving it at least for several months. The exact exposure for each child was not known, neither the number of days nor the quality of iodization, and could not therefore be included in the analysis. Thus the comparison group was not a no-iodine control, which would have been unethical in this context, but rather a delayed exposure comparison. Thus the lack of an overall difference between groups in mental development may be because of similar endline levels of exposure to iodized salt or to over 5 years of insufficient iodine to support thyroid hormone activity in brain development. If exposure to iodized salt for a minimum of 4 months is as beneficial as 10 months, then it suggests that even a short exposure to iodized salt is valuable at this age. However, if the lack of difference is because of 'too little, too late' exposure for both groups, then the interpretation is that 5 years of early development with inadequate axon growth, dendritic branching and myelination cannot be easily reversed. In support of the latter interpretation, intervention children with educated mothers benefited more from iodized salt; they may have received more stimulation in the early years, with more synaptic growth and less pruning of unused neurons. Myelination continues for a number of years after birth but cannot coat axons that have been deleted.",
