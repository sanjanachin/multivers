Methods: Randomized controlled trial in which 120 infants were assigned to either group A with higher enteral protein intake achieved by fortification with higher protein containing fortifier (1 g/100 mL expressed breast milk) or to group B with lower enteral protein intake where fortification was done with standard available protein fortifier (0.4 g /100 mL expressed breast milk). Results: The mean (standard deviation) protein intake was higher in group A as compared to group B; 4.2 (0.47) compared with 3.6 (0.37) g \u00c1 kg \u00c01 \u00c1 day \u00c01 , P < 0.001. At 40 weeks PMA, the mean (standard deviation) weekly occipitofrontal circumference gain was significantly higher in group A as compared to group B; 0.66 (0.16) compared with 0.60 (0.15) cm/week (mean difference 0.064, 95% confidence interval [0.004-0.123], [P \u00bc 0.04]).

No difference was observed in the length between the 2 groups. There was no difference in growth indices and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 to 18 months corrected age in the 2 groups. Conclusions: Fortification of expressed human milk with fortifier containing higher protein results in better head growth and weight gain at 40 weeks PMA in preterm infants <32 weeks or 1500 g without any benefits on long-term growth and neurodevelopment at 12 to 18 months corrected age (CTRI/2014/06/004661).",

In a similar study by Miller et al (17) , length gains did not differ between the higher and standard protein groups. In contrast, Olsen et al (18) in a study on protein fortification showed better length z scores in neonates who received higher protein (4.6-5.5 g \u00c1 kg \u00c01 \u00c1 day \u00c01 ). Similar beneficial effects of higher protein fortification on short-term growth were reported in a recent meta-analysis, which compared the growth of preterm infants fed standard proteinfortified human milk (0.7-1.1 g extra protein per 100 mL EBM) with that containing HMF with higher-than-standard protein content. The meta-analysis included 5 studies with 352 infants with birth weight 1750 g and a gestational age 34 weeks. Infants in the higher-than-standard protein fortifier achieved significantly greater weight gain, length gain, and head circumference gain at the study end compared with standard HMF (7) .",
