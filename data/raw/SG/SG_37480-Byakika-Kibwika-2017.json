        "text": "Background: Severe malaria is a medical emergency associated with high mortality. Adequate treatment requires initial parenteral therapy for fast parasite clearance followed by longer acting oral antimalarial drugs for cure and prevention of recrudescence. Methods: In a randomized controlled clinical trial, we evaluated the 42-day parasitological outcomes of severe malaria treatment with intravenous artesunate (AS) or intravenous quinine (QNN) followed by oral artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) in children living in a high malaria transmission setting in Eastern Uganda. Results: We enrolled 300 participants and all were included in the intention to treat analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms. The median and interquartile range for number of days from baseline to parasite clearance was significantly lower among participants who received intravenous AS (2 (1-2) vs 3 (2-3), P < 0. 001). Overall, 63.3% (178/281) of the participants had unadjusted parasitological treatment failure over the 42-day follow-up period. Molecular genotyping to distinguish re-infection from recrudescence was performed in a sample of 127 of the 178 participants, of whom majority 93 (73.2%) had re-infection and 34 (26.8%) had recrudescence. The 42 day risk of recrudescence did not differ with ACT administered. Adverse events were of mild to moderate severity and consistent with malaria symptoms. Conclusion: In this high transmission setting, we observed adequate initial treatment outcomes followed by very high rates of malaria re-infection post severe malaria treatment. The impact of recurrent antimalarial treatment on the long term efficacy of antimalarial regimens needs to be investigated and surveillance mechanisms for resistance markers established since recurrent malaria infections are likely to be exposed to sub-therapeutic drug concentrations. More strategies for prevention of recurrent malaria infections in the most at risk populations are needed. Trial registration: The study was registered with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201110000321348).",

The risk of death for patients with severe malaria is high and increases with delayed initiation of treatment and in presence of multiple complications. Risk of death is also dependent on the patient's age, background immunity, pre-morbid and concomitant diseases.

Our previous study demonstrated longer duration of illness before receiving antimalarial medication among children presenting to hospital with severe malaria compared to those who had uncomplicated malaria [19] .

Majority of our study participants classified as treatment failure actually suffered re-infection with malaria parasites during the 42-day follow-up period, with higher reinfection rates among participants who received AS + ACT compared to QNN + ACT regimens. Our findings are consistent with previous data from similar high malaria transmission settings which demonstrated high rates of re-infection with malaria parasites after initial treatment [20, 21] . Our finding of the highest re-infection rates among participants who received AS + DP although not statistically significant, is surprising and difficult to explain since piperaquine which is the longer acting partner drug in the DP combination is known to have a long half-life of about 35 days compared to lumefantrine's half-life of 28 days, thus is expected to offer longer post treatment prophylactic effect [12, 21, 22] . Previous studies reported lower malaria re-infection rates following treatment with DP compared to AL [20, 21] , our findings are possibly limited by the small study numbers for that comparison. Recurrent malaria infections have been associated with higher risk for development of symptomatic malaria disease than recrudescent parasitemia [21, 23] . The high malaria re-infection rate is particularly significant in patients who have suffered severe malaria attacks since re-infection is likely to result into recurrent attacks of severe malaria with co-morbidity such as anaemia and resultant negative health and social-economic impact. Although we did not evaluate the information given to patients at discharge; we emphasize the importance of education of patients and caretakers on enhancing malaria prevention.",
