Materials and Methods: Participants aged 11 to 16 years with T1DM (duration \u22651 year) from 4 UK-based paediatric diabetes centres were randomised to receive either 6 weekly sessions of 1-to-1 CBT (n = 43) or NDC (n = 42), with 2 further sessions at 6 and 12 months. Follow-up continued for 12 months postintervention. Outcome measures included glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and psychological scores. Results: The HbA1c levels were available in 33 patients in each group for analysis. Between group difference of the overall changes in HbA1c across the study period was statically significant (P = .018). Geometric mean (range) HbA1c in the NDC group deteriorated from 68 (46-113) to 78 (48-128) mmol/mol (ie, 8.4 [6.4-12.5]% to 9.3 [6.5-13.9]%; P = .001), but was maintained in the CBT group from 72 (46-129) to 73 (51-128) mmol/mol (P = .51) (ie, 8.7 [6.4-14]% to 8.9 [6.8-13.9]%).
