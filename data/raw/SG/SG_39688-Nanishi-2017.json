Therefore, we aimed to assess the efficacy of clarithromycin, an antibiofilm agent, in patients with Kawasaki disease. Methods and Results-We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 2 trial at 8 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients included children aged between 4 months and 5 years who were enrolled between days 4 and 8 of illness. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or IVIG plus clarithromycin. The primary end point was the duration of fever after the initiation of IVIG treatment. Eighty-one eligible patients were randomized. The duration of the fever did not differ between the 2 groups (meanAESD, 34.3AE32.4 and 31.1AE31.1 hours in the IVIG plus clarithromycin group and the IVIG group, respectively [P=0.66]). The relapse rate of patients in the IVIG plus clarithromycin group was significantly lower than that in the IVIG group (12.5% versus 30.8%, P=0.046). No serious adverse events occurred during the study period. In a post hoc analysis, the patients in the IVIG plus clarithromycin group required significantly shorter mean lengths of hospital stays than those in the IVIG group (8.9 days versus 10.3 days, P=0.049). Conclusions-Although IVIG plus clarithromycin therapy failed to shorten the duration of fever, it reduced the relapse rate and shortened the duration of hospitalization in patients with Kawasaki disease.",

It has been reported that the relapse rate ranges from 3.5% to 22.5%, although the criteria of \"relapse\" have not been well described. 23, [47] [48] [49] An epidemiological study indicated changes in the incidence of IVIG-resistant KD. 50 The disease severity, which can lead to a high incidence of relapse, might have been higher in our study than in previous studies. Second, we estimated the number of patients needed for this study to achieve statistically significant results based on the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities, but not the primary end point, as we had no large-scale reference data concerning fevers in patients with KD, which were measured at a relatively short interval of 4 hours. Furthermore, we used a high level of a (20%, 1-sided) for the sample size calculation and statistical analysis for the primary end point. Pilot or exploratory phase 2 studies designed to evaluate potential efficacy could be conducted with a high level of a up to 25%, which allows a smaller sample size and shorter study period. 51, 52 Although we consider that the high level of a in the current study was permissive, a large-scale, confirmatory phase 3 study should be designed in more standardized manner. Third, we used minimization, a dynamic allocation method that can balance known prognostic factors between treatment groups. The minimization method is gaining popularity, however, considerable controversy exists over its proper application because it might not be taken as a truly random method. 53, 54 Therefore, we confirmed the robustness of the primary analysis by the sensitivity analysis. Finally, this study used an open-label design, and none of the patients or researchers were blinded. Furthermore, although the reduction of the relapse rate and duration of hospital stay was statistically significant, the upper limit of the 95% CI of the OR for relapse rate was 0.98 and the upper limit of the 95% CI of the difference for duration of hospitalization was 0.0 day. We could not exclude the possibility of the modest effect of clarithromycin in this small scaled trial. The statistically significant results in this study were obtained by secondary and post hoc analyses, which were unadjusted for multiple testing. We should consider the reproducibility of the results because we cannot ignore the effect of multiple testing. To clarify the precise effect of clarithromycin in patients with KD, a phase 3, double-blinded, confirmatory study is underway (UMIN000024311).",
