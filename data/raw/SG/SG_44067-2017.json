We examined the effects of low (LD) versus high dietary acid load (HD) on blood acid-base status and exercise performance. Participants included 22 adolescents, 33 young adults (YA), and 33 elderly (EL), who followed a 7-day LD and HD in a randomized order.

At the beginning of and after the diet periods, blood samples were collected at rest and after all workloads. Oxygen uptake, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and heart rate (HR) were monitored during cycling. In YA and EL, bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u2212) and base excess (BE) decreased over the HD period, and HCO 3 \u2212 , BE, and pH were lower at rest after HD compared with LD. In YA and EL women, HCO 3 \u2212 and BE were lower at submaximal workloads after HD compared with LD. In YA women, the maximal workload was 19% shorter and maximal oxygen uptake, RER, and HR were lower after HD compared with LD. Our data uniquely suggests that better renal function is associated with higher availability of bases, which may diminish exercise-induced acidosis and improve maximal aerobic performance.

        "text": "Diet composition is known to influence net endogenous acid production, which may further affect acid-base status of the body (Poupin et al. 2012) . Dietary acid load can be estimated by calcu-lating the potential renal acid load (PRAL) of foods, which represents the renal net acid excretion caused by a foodstuff (Remer et al. 2003) . The digestion of meat, grain, and some dairy products increases the acid load of the body. Fruits and vegetables, which contain organic anions (e.g., citrate, malate) metabolizable to bicarbonate, lower net acid load. Western diet typically contains large amounts of animal protein and grain products but only small amounts of vegetables and fruits, and leads to a net production of acids in the body (Adeva and Souto 2011) . For elderly populations, the dietary acid load may be a particularly important issue as aging is associated with a decline in the renal functional capacity, which diminishes the accuracy and speed of the regulation of volume and composition of the body fluids (Bolignano et al. 2014) . Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases with aging and consequently, blood HCO 3 \u2212 concentration and pH are regulated at lower levels (Frassetto and Sebastian 1996) . Increased acidity of the body has been reported to associate negatively with kidney function, bone health, and muscle mass. For example, in the study of Scialla et al. (2012) , higher net endogenous acid production was significantly associated with a faster decline in GFR. Tabatabai et al. (2015) found out that lower plasma HCO 3 \u2212 was associated with higher rate of bone loss in 70-year-old participants. In addition, Dawson-Hughes et al. (2008) came to the conclusion that higher intake of fruits and vegetables, which contain base-producing compounds and decrease net endogenous acid production, favored the preservation of muscle mass in men and women over 65 years of age.",

        "text": "In addition to the health issues, dietary acid load may play a role in exercise. Over the decades, many studies have reported the positive effects of sodium bicarbonate supplementation and some other ergogenic aids on blood buffering capacity and exercise performance (Krustrup et al. 2015; Wilkes et al. 1983) . Surprisingly, there are only a few studies that have investigated the impact of diet composition on acid-base status and exercise performance (e.g., Baguet et al. 2011; Caciano et al. 2015; Greenhaff et al. 1987 ; for review see Applegate et al. 2017) . Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of dietary acid load on acid-base status of the elderly have not been reported during exercise. Increasing hydrogen ion (H + ) concentrations in blood and muscle during high-intensity exercise cause acidosis, which is thought to be one of the causes of fatigue (Lancha Junior et al. 2015; Robergs et al. 2004) . A diet high in vegetables and fruits could have the potential to affect blood bicarbonate buffering capacity and physical performance by attenuating the exercise-induced acidosis. For example, sodium bicarbonate supplementation has been reported to improve performance both in short (\u03f31-2 min) (Mero et al. 2013; Van Montfoort et al. 2004) and longer (\u03f320 min) exercise performances (O\u00f6pik et al. 2003) . The main purpose of this paper was to find out if low dietary acid load (LD) and high dietary acid load (HD) have effects on blood acid-base status and exercise performance during submaximal and maximal aerobic cycling in adolescents, young adults, and the elderly. We hypothesized that a diet with high acid load increases acidity of the blood and age-related decline in renal function affects the responses in acid-base parameters both at rest and in exercise.",

To recruit the AD group, we visited the local sports clubs who were participating in ice hockey, figure skating, gymnastics, and athletics. The YA and EL groups were recruited via e-mail lists. The subjects of YA group were mainly students in the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and the communitydwelling EL subjects were recruited from the Ageing Program of the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. All subjects of YA and EL were recreationally active (e.g., walking, jogging, cycling, resistance training 2-4 times per week) but they were not training for competitive purposes. In the beginning of the study, there were 14 boys and 10 girls in the AD group, 16 men and 19 women in the YA group, and 17 men and 17 women in the EL group. Altogether 5 subjects were not able to finish the study. Baseline anthropometric characteristics of the subjects who completed the whole data collection are presented in Table 1 . The subjects did not use any medication during the study period aside from 2 exceptions: women of YA were allowed to use contraceptive pills and in the EL groups medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol were acceptable. Subjects whose body mass index was above 33 kg/m 2 or who had other medications were excluded from the study. The experimental diets were planned beforehand and volunteers who had any relevant food allergy were not able to participate. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and the study was in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Before any data collection the subjects were informed of the purpose and the methods of the study and they signed a written informed consent.

(2015) , submaximal and maximal RER were lower after a 7-day low-PRAL diet and there were only trends towards a longer time to exhaustion and greater V O 2max during a graded treadmill exercise test. The blood acid-base parameters were not measured during that study. In our study, the difference in carbohydrate intakes between the diet groups is one of the limitations of this study, and lower carbohydrate intake may have influenced the RER values and exercise capacity during HD. However, we think the difference in the intake of carbohydrates was not large enough to solely explain the difference in time to exhaustion by lower muscle glycogen availability. In the group of young women, the cycling tests performed during the study lasted approximately 33 min. Of that, 20 min were cycled at 35% and 55% of V O 2max , when fat is the most dominant source of energy (Knuiman et al. 2015 ). Subjects were not engaging in high-intensity exercise during the study periods. Moreover, according to the body composition analysis, the weight of body fluids was not reduced over the HD period, which strengthens the postulation that the muscle glycogen stores were not depleted prior the cycling tests during the HD period.",

The effects of dietary acid load are larger in the elderly compared with younger persons and in women compared with men, which is likely explained by the differences in GFR. Maintaining better renal function with aging may be associated with higher availability of bases, which also may diminish exercise-induced acidosis and decrease the need of aging kidneys to excrete acids. Decreased alkalinity of the blood may also impair maximal aerobic performance, such as occurred in the young women in this study. We conclude that the diet composition along with renal functional capacity affects acid-base status of the body at rest and in exercise. The significance of the dietary acid load as a part of a healthy diet needs to be studied further.",
