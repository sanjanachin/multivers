Before completing the tasks in a positive mood, 120 children 7-10 years were exposed to either a safety norm or a control audio. Results The control audio had no effect: children showed an increase in risk taking and intentions when in a positive mood compared with a neutral mood, replicating past research. In contrast, exposure to the safety norm counteracted this effect: children showed a decrease in risk taking and intentions when in a positive mood compared with a neutral mood.

        "text": "In a recent study, exposing children to peercommunicated social norms favoring safety was found to reduce risk taking . Extending this finding, the current results demonstrate that the positive effects of social norm exposure can even be realized when children are in a heightened positive mood state that typically predicts an increase in their frequency of risk taking (Morrongiello et al., 2015) . In fact, not only did the peer safety norm counteract the increase in risk behaviors, it served to significantly reduce risk taking when in a positive mood compared with a neutral mood. This is an important finding because social norm manipulation is an approach to injury prevention that can have universal application and reach a large number of youth simultaneously. Hence, it is more cost-effective than interventions delivered individually or in small groups. Entire college campuses, for example, have been successfully targeted in interventions using a social norms approach to reduce problem health behaviors like smoking, drinking, and sexual assault (Hancock & Henry, 2003; Johannessen & Gilder, 2003; Rodrieguez, Kulley, & Barrow, 2003; White, Williams, & Cho, 2003) .",

        "text": "Typically, perception of social norms is predictive of increased engagement in health-risk behaviors because people commonly overestimate their peers' propensity to engage in risky behaviors and justify their own problem behaviors on this basis (Borsari & Carey, 2003; Scholly, Katz, Gascoigne, & Holck, 2005) . In a study of heavy episodic drinking in college students, for example, >50% of students overestimated the frequency at which their peers engage in heavy episodic drinking and this motivated their own personal frequency of excess alcohol consumption (Franc\u00b8a, Dautzenberg, & Reynaud, 2010 ). Although we did not ask children to estimate how other children would likely behave, the data support that they were responding to the social norm aspect of the communications. In previous studies in which children directly tried to influence other children's risk-taking decisions in contrived face-to-face situations, for example, we found that discouragement statements were not effective, unless a close friend made the statements (Christensen & Morrongiello, 1997) . In contrast, we obtained a high level of responsiveness in the current study even though the peers were unknown to the participants. The contrastive pattern of these findings across studies indicates that statements discouraging a risk behavior can be effective if they are communicated in a social-norm framework. The fact that exposure to the safety norm was successful to reduce risk taking indicates that the children both internalized the safety message and used it to guide their own behavioral choices when they were subsequently in a risk situation to which the norm applied. Moreover, they did this when in an elevated positive mood state. Thus, this intervention approach was able to override emotion-based determinants of risk taking, which are substantial Morrongiello & Matheis, 2004) . At the least, the current findings suggest that social norm interventions focusing on peer influences hold much promise for injury prevention programs targeting specific risk practices among children.",

        "text": "The current study reveals important insights regarding how social norms can be used to reduce children's risk taking. Nonetheless, there are some limitations to this study that merit mentioning and should be addressed in future research. First, the sample was relatively homogeneous in demographic characteristics and, therefore, the findings may not generalize to more diverse populations. Recruiting a more ethnically and economically diverse sample in future research is an important next step. It is essential to confirm the same effects are obtained with a diverse sample before implementing social norm interventions at a community level. Second, although the mood manipulation was effective to achieve the desired effects, there is no way to know how this level of positive mood compares with what children typically experience during the course of their days and when with peers. We are likely underestimating how much risk taking increases when in a positive mood, especially if friends are involved. The magnitude of effect of social norm on risk taking that we observed, therefore, may be a conservative estimate. To address this possibility, it would be important to examine how children's risk taking varies during the course of typical variations in mood that occur daily and with friends. For example, comparing risk behaviors that children show in the current task, with how they behave when positive mood is elevated during a gym class with friends, could provide data that speak to the issue of whether our findings underestimate mood influences on risk taking. Finally, determining whether child susceptibility to social norm messaging when in a positive mood state varies depending on dispositional characteristics also would be an important next step in future studies. Higher levels of need for approval and social anxiety in adolescents are both factors that are predictive of being more susceptible to peer influence (Beidel & Alfano, 2011; Smith & Flenning, 1971 ). These same attributes, therefore, may affect the extent of impact of social norms on behavior change in young children. Extending the current study to determine whether attributes like need for approval predispose children to be more responsive to perceived social norms is one way to address this issue. Related to this, systematic research examining how the wording of social norm communications influences children's behaviors is warranted. The current wording included negatively framing the norm message (i.e., fools do the risk behavior) and this may have affected children's attention to or memory for the norm message. In future research, it would be useful to determine the characteristics that define effective social norm messages for young children.",
