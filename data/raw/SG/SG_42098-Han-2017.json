        "text": "Background: Sevoflurane and ketamine are commonly used to obtain sedation and facilitate intravenous anesthetic induction in children undergoing cardiac surgery who are uncooperative. We used a new and direct systemic hemodynamic monitoring technique pressure recording analytical method and compared the hemodynamic effects of sevoflurane and ketamine to facilitate intravenous anesthetic induction. Methods: Forty-four children with ventricular septal defect (2.2 \u00b1 1.2 years) were enrolled and randomized to receive sevoflurane (Group S) or intramuscular ketamine (Group K) for sedation, followed by intravenous midazolam-sufentanil induction and tracheal intubation. Recorded parameters included heart rate (HR), arterial pressures, stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), the maximal slope of systolic upstroke (dp/dt max) after sedation obtained with sevoflurane or ketamine, 1, 2, 5 minutes after midazolam-sufentanil, 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes after tracheal intubation. Rate-pressure product (RPP) and cardiac power output (CPO) were calculated. Results: As compared with Group S, Group K had faster decreases during intravenous anesthetic induction in arterial pressures (P < .01 for all), higher HR, arterial pressures, SVRI, dp/dt max , RPP, lower SVI, CI, CPO (P < .05 for all) during the study period. Conclusion: As compared with sevoflurane, ketamine facilitated intravenous anesthetic induction exerts unfavorable effects on systemic hemodynamic and myocardial energetic in children with ventricular septal defect.

        "text": "Inhaled sevoflurane and intramuscular ketamine are both extensively used in unmanageable and ambulatory children undergoing cardiac catheterization or surgery, to obtain sedation, facilitate venous access, and intravenous anesthesia induction. [1, 2] But knowledge about their effects on systemic hemodynamics remains limited largely due to the technical difficulties in direct assessments of these variables. Sevoflurane has been considered as well tolerated and does not induce significant change in pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio in children with CHD. [3] [4] [5] Ketamine, as a potent analgesic and sympathetic stimulating agent, is preferred by some others. [6, 7] In most of those studies, only heart rate and arterial pressure, that is, indirect indicators in clinical routine monitoring, were used. It has been learned that these indirect indicators do not accurately reflect a true hemodynamic status. [8, 9] Efforts have been made to develop techniques to directly assess hemodynamic parameters, such as stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, etc. Among them, thermodilution method has been widely used. But the presence of interventricular shunt, pulmonary, and tricuspid regurgitation commonly seen in CHD precludes its use. In addition, the repeated cold saline injections may affect the physiological status. The Fick method using the directly measured systemic oxygen consumption such as by respiratory mass spectrometry remains the gold standard method, and has been used in varied circulations in children with CHD. [10, 11] However, respiratory mass spectrometry is technically and timely highly demanding and hardly used outside of clinical research setting. Pressure recording analytical method (PRAM, MostCare, Vygon Vytech, Padova, Italy) is a minimally invasive and user-friendly method to provide direct and continuous measurements of systemic hemodynamics based on mathematical analysis of the arterial waveform. One recent study [12] validated PRAM against the Fick method in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, which found a close correlation in the measurements of cardiac index. PRAM has been increasingly used in many studies in children with CHD before and after cardiac surgery and provided meaningful data. [12] [13] [14] [15] Therefore, our study aimed to use PRAM to examine the effects of ketamine and sevoflurane on systemic hemodynamics during the entire course of anesthetic induction and intubation in children undergoing surgery for complete repair of ventricular septal defect.",

The different hemodynamic effects of sevoflurane and ketamine might be more significant in large-sized ventricular septal defect or cyanotic CHD, which warrants further study. Hemodynamic measurements prior to sevoflurane and ketamine administration were not provided. Therefore, alterations in patient hemodynamics during anesthetic induction were not fully depicted. This is because it is impossible to place an arterial catheter without sedation in children. Nonetheless, our study was conducted with randomization and tight control of the study protocol in both the groups. Our results of comparison between the 2 agents during the entire course of anesthetic induction and intubation were considered valid. The differences observed in our study between the 2 groups may be confounded by the fact that the 2 anesthetic induction agents, inhaled sevoflurane and intramuscular ketamine, are eliminated with different kinetics, sevoflurane is fast and ketamine slow. But our study aimed to compare the 2 anesthetic induction regimen and their ongoing effects on hemodynamics during the entire period of induction and intubation, rather than just the 2 drugs when administered. There is concern that after inhalation of 100% oxygen the intracardiac shunting can be substantially different with parallel influence caused by the different hemodynamic effects of anesthetics. Nevertheless, a previous study [4] found sevoflurane administered with 100% oxygen did not change systemic and pulmonary blood flow ratio. PRAM device has limitations in itself, there have been some concerns of some factors that might limit the reliability of PRAM in pediatric patients, such as location of arterial catheter, an over-or under-damping signal from arterial transducer. [27] We used fast flush test to preclude artifacts exit. Consequently none of our patients were excluded from the study due to artificial arterial pressure contours, potentially due to special arterial properties in children.",

            "Therefore, alterations in patient hemodynamics during anesthetic induction were not fully depicted.",
            "This is because it is impossible to place an arterial catheter without sedation in children.",
            "Nonetheless, our study was conducted with randomization and tight control of the study protocol in both the groups.",
            "Our results of comparison between the 2 agents during the entire course of anesthetic induction and intubation were considered valid.",
            "The differences observed in our study between the 2 groups may be confounded by the fact that the 2 anesthetic induction agents, inhaled sevoflurane and intramuscular ketamine, are eliminated with different kinetics, sevoflurane is fast and ketamine slow.",
            "But our study aimed to compare the 2 anesthetic induction regimen and their ongoing effects on hemodynamics during the entire period of induction and intubation, rather than just the 2 drugs when administered.",
            "There is concern that after inhalation of 100% oxygen the intracardiac shunting can be substantially different with parallel influence caused by the different hemodynamic effects of anesthetics.",
            "Nevertheless, a previous study [4] found sevoflurane administered with 100% oxygen did not change systemic and pulmonary blood flow ratio.",
            "PRAM device has limitations in itself, there have been some concerns of some factors that might limit the reliability of PRAM in pediatric patients, such as location of arterial catheter, an over-or under-damping signal from arterial transducer. [",
            "27] We used fast flush test to preclude artifacts exit.",
            "Consequently none of our patients were excluded from the study due to artificial arterial pressure contours, potentially due to special arterial properties in children."
