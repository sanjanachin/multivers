We assessed the effectiveness of an antimicrobial stewardship programme aiming to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in paediatric outpatients by targeting providers and caregivers in primary care hospitals in rural China. Methods We did a pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial with a 6-month intervention period. Clusters were primary care township hospitals in two counties of Guangxi province in China, which were randomly allocated to the intervention group or the control group (in a 1:1 ratio in Rong county and in a 5:6 ratio in Liujiang county). Randomisation was stratified by county. Eligible participants were children aged 2-14 years who attended a township hospital as an outpatient and were given a prescription following a primary diagnosis of an upper respiratory tract infection. The intervention included clinician guidelines and training on appropriate prescribing, monthly prescribing peer-review meetings, and brief caregiver education. In hospitals allocated to the control group, usual care was provided, with antibiotics prescribed at the individual clinician's discretion. Patients were masked to their allocated treatment group but doctors were not. The primary outcome was the antibiotic prescription rate in children attending the hospitals, defined as the cluster-level proportion of prescriptions for upper respiratory tract infections in 2-14-year-old outpatients, issued during the final 3 months of the 6-month intervention period (endline), that included one or more antibiotics. The outcome was based on prescription records and analysed by modified intention-to-treat. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN14340536.

We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar from Jan 1, 1980, to Dec 31, 2016, for published studies, using the following keywords: \"antibiotics\", \"antibiotic prescribing\", \"primary care\", \"respiratory infections\", \"respiratory diseases\", \"education\", \"training\", \"RCT\", and \"randomised controlled trial\". We identified 129 studies, including 13 trials reporting results relating to interventions for reducing antibiotic prescription rates in primary care settings. Of these trials, 11 were done in high-income countries (five in the USA, four in Europe, one in Canada, and one in Israel), and two in low-income or middle-income countries (LMICs; one in China and one in Iran). The duration of interventions ranged from 3 months to 3 years, targeting either clinicians (nine trials), patients or caregivers (one), or both (three). The pooled absolute risk reduction in the antibiotic prescription rate for intervention versus control was -4\u20226% (95% CI -6\u20224 to -2\u20229; p<0\u20220001). Existing evidence suggested that training using guidelines produces a small reduction in the antibiotic prescription rate (ie, <5% absolute risk reduction in rate), whereas monitoring and feedback of prescribing behaviour achieves a slightly higher reduction (7-9%). One study in Quebec, Canada, involved patients in decision-making and reduced the absolute risk reduction in antibiotic prescription rate by 25%, but the sample size was small (n=9 clusters). The two trials in developing countries were not adequately designed or reported. Whether or not such interventions could be implemented in developing countries where overuse of antibiotics is more challenging was unclear.",

Under the assumption of a coefficient of variation of 0\u202215, 10% loss of data from illegible prescriptions, and allowing for stratification, we required 24 clusters to detect a decrease of this magnitude or greater with 90% power, using two-sided testing at the 5% significance level, and so we included all 25 eligible clusters within the two counties. 20 We pooled both internal pilot and main trial data for analysis, and controlled for seasonality by comparing the endline antibiotic prescription rate between the intervention and control group during the same period. No interim analysis was done. We analysed cluster-level summary endline outcomes using methods appropriate for stratified, cluster-randomised trials with relatively few clusters per group, accounting for between-cluster variation. 12, 20 We estimated the crude absolute effect of the intervention on the antibiotic prescription rate by estimating the risk difference for the endline antibiotic prescription rate, based on a weighted average of stratumspecific cluster-level endline risk differences, with weights inversely proportional to stratum-specific variances. We calculated the 95% CIs for this risk difference, and did a formal hypothesis test (two-sided and at the 5% level), via a stratified t-test. To adjust for covariates, we fitted a logistic regression to the individuallevel primary outcome endline data, controlling for covariates of interest except the treatment effect. We then calculated covariate-adjusted cluster-level difference residuals from the model-predicted and observed values, and analysed these using the same method as described above. We analysed secondary proportion outcomes using the same methods, and also present crude and adjusted risk ratio results for all antibiotic prescription rate outcomes. We used the same methods to analyse the quantitative cost outcomes, but with cluster-level means in place of proportions for the crude analysis, and with normal linear regression used instead of logistic regression to calculate covariate-adjusted difference residuals (resulting in crude or adjusted mean differences). We also did a range of exploratory (not protocol-planned) subgroup analyses on the primary outcome based on patient-level and doctor-level characteristics (see appendix p 3 for methods). We did not adjust the type 1 error rate for our secondary outcome and subgroup analyses, but treated them as helping us to interpret our primary outcome results. 21 Adjusted results controlled for stratum (county); cluster-level summary outcome at baseline; patient's sex, age, and payment type (insured or fully out-of-pocket); and doctor's sex, age, and qualification level (\u22653 years or \u22655 years). Crude analyses were done on an intention-totreat basis, whereas adjusted and subgroup analyses were on a modified intention-to-treat basis due to the use of complete cases for which covariate data were missing.

Third, some contamination between intervention and control clusters might have occurred because the townships in different groups were sometimes next to each other, potentially reducing effect sizes.

Fifth, inappropriate use of antibiotics is also a widespread problem in adults in LMICs. We designed the trial for children because overuse of antibiotics is more challenging in this patient population because parents often demand antibiotics to enable a potentially more rapid recovery. Additionally, we did not include children younger than 2 years old, which limits the generalisability of trial results to all children. Future studies could include patients of all ages. The guidelines regarding appropriate antibiotic use are designed for all patients. Similarly, the addition of more training on guidelines for use of multiple antibiotics, antivirals, and intravenous infusions might be necessary. Finally, given our inability to mask doctors in the trial, it is possible that the Hawthorne effect could account for part of the intervention effect.
