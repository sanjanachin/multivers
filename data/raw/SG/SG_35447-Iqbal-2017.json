Aim: To see the efficacy of pre-extubation administration of propofol to prevent this. Method: 80 patients between 4-12 years of age undergoing tonsillectomy were studied in two groups of 40 each. In group A no propofol was administered while in group B propofol 1 mg/kg was administered at the time of extubation before suctioning. Results: Out of 40 patients in group A 17 developed laryngospasm needing further management, while only 1 patient in group B developed laryngospasm. The statistical difference was highly significant. Conclusion: Administering propofol just before extubation can successfully prevent laryngospasm in majority of peadiatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy.",
