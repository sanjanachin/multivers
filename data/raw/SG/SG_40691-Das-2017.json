We hypothesized that intubation would be easier with Airtraq\u2122 compared to Miller blade. Hence, we compared Airtraq\u2122 with the Miller laryngoscope as intubation devices in paediatric patients. Methods: This prospective, randomized study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Sixty children belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists' Grade I-II, aged 2-10 years, posted for routine surgery requiring tracheal intubation were randomly allocated to undergo intubation using a Miller (n = 30) or Airtraq\u2122 (n = 30) laryngoscope. The primary outcome measure was time of intubation. We also measured ease of intubation, number of attempts, percentage of glottic opening score (POGO), haemodynamic changes and airway trauma. Student t test was used to analyse parametric data. Results: Intubation time was comparable between Miller's laryngoscope (15.13 \u00b1 1.33s) compared to Airtraq\u2122 (11.53 \u00b1 0.49 s) (P = 0.29) The number of first and second attempts at intubation were 25 and 5 for the Miller laryngoscope and 29 and 1 for the Airtraq\u2122. Median visual analogue score (VAS) for ease of intubation was 5 in Miller group compared to 3 in Airtraq\u2122 group. The median POGO score was 75 in the Miller group and 100 in the Airtraq\u2122 group (P = 0.01). Haemodynamic changes were maximum and most significant immediately and 1 min after intubation. Airway trauma occurred in three patients (9.09%) in Miller group and one patient (3.33%) in Airtraq\u2122 group. Conclusion: The Airtraq\u2122 reduced the difficulty of tracheal intubation and degree of haemodynamic stimulation compared to the Miller laryngoscope in paediatric patients.",
