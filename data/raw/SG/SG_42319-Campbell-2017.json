        "text": "Objectives: Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) may inhibit growth and development in low-and middle-income countries, but available assessment methodologies limit its study. In rural Bangladesh, we measured EED using the widely used lactulose mannitol ratio (L:M) test and a panel of intestinal and systemic health biomarkers to evaluate convergence among biomarkers and describe risk factors for EED. Methods: In 539 18-month-old children finishing participation in a randomized food supplementation trial, serum, stool, and urine collected after lactulose and mannitol dosing were analyzed for biomarkers of intestinal absorption, inflammation, permeability and repair, and systemic inflammation. EED scores for each participant were developed using principal component analysis and partial least squares regression. Associations between scores and L:M and with child sociodemographic and health characteristics were evaluated using regression analysis. Results: EED prevalence (L:M > 0.07) was 39.0%; 60% had elevated acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein >5 mg/L or a-1 acid glycoprotein >100 mg/dL). Correlations between intestinal biomarkers were low, with the highest between myeloperoxidase and a-1 antitrypsin (r \u00bc 0.33, P < 0.01), and biomarker values did not differ by supplementation history. A 1-factor partial least squares model with L:M as the dependent variable explained only 8.6% of L:M variability. In adjusted models, L:M was associated with child sex and socioeconomic status index, whereas systemic inflammation was predicted mainly by recent illness, not EED. Conclusions: Impaired intestinal health is widespread in this setting of prevalent stunting, but a panel of serum and stool biomarkers demonstrated poor agreement with L:M. Etiologies of intestinal and systemic inflammation are likely numerous and complex in resource-poor settings, underscoring the need for a better case definition with corresponding diagnostic methods to further the study of EED.",

Although approximately 40%, the observed prevalence of EED based on elevated L:M was less than half of that reported in other studies in young children in South Asia (6, 7) . Widespread access to improved sanitation facilities and tubewell drinking water in this rural Bangladesh setting may reduce prevalence of EED, as may exposure among mothers in all arms of the study to messaging about food handling and hygiene. Variable findings from prior studies using L:M cast some doubt, however, on the extent to which it can be considered a ''criterion standard'' diagnostic test for EED (2, 19) . At best L:M measures only 2 aspects of the intestinal pathology characteristic of EED: increased permeability and reduced absorptive capacity, whereas the panel of serum and stool biomarkers in the present study was selected deliberately to assess the EED condition more broadly. Concerns have also been raised that mannitol can be present naturally in the urine (2, 34) , and that the high pressure ion chromatography method may lack sensitivity for determining typically low lactulose concentrations (35) . In addition to underscoring the need for a better diagnostic test for EED, these limitations suggest that the alternate biomarkers presented here may be capturing aspects of the EED condition despite low agreement with L:M. L:M has been widely used to define EED despite its limitations, and hence our aim of evaluating the biomarker panel relative to it. The PLS method is well-suited to that purpose, because it identifies patterns of joint variability between specified independent and dependent variables (33) . The PLS-generated score inclusive of all of the biomarkers did explain the most variance in L:M of the models investigated, but that maximum was <10% of the total variability in L:M. Furthermore, 5 of 12 biomarkers across the intestinal and systemic domains loaded with moderate and approximately equal strength in that model, supporting the conclusion that no concise subset of the measured markers approximates L:M. The PCA-generated scores offer more insight than the 1factor PLS score does into the joint variability and common underlying factors within the set of serum and stool biomarkers. The GI score, on which MPO, AAT, and NEO loaded, was not associated with any of the examined child and household factors aside from past 7-day fever, underscoring uncertainty about the factors underlying those biomarkers and their common variability. In 2 other studies that took a similar PCA approach to stool markers of EED, similar magnitudes of loadings for MPO, AAT, and NEO were reported (13, 36) , but only in our study did NEO load in the opposite direction of MPO and AAT. A score of MPO, AAT, and NEO as a stand-alone marker of EED has been proposed by investigators from the Malnutrition and Enteric Diseases study (13) , but our findings suggest more research is needed into the physiology underlying those markers and into the processes driving their joint variability. In particular, the inverse relationship we observed between NEO and MPO and NEO and AAT concurs to some extent with a recent study in Brazil suggesting the relationship between NEO and growth may be modified by MPO or, said differently, that high NEO in the absence of high MPO may be indicative of normal intestinal immune function, whereas high NEO and MPO together indicate excessive inflammation, as in EED, that constrains growth (37) . A diagnostic measure that uses these markers in combination may, then, be appropriate, but more normative data and validation studies in subclinical disease, ideally in pediatric populations, are needed to fully understand the biology underlying these markers.",

Accounting for the directionality of the loading for EndoCAb on that score, this finding means children from wealthier households and with greater LAZ at baseline had higher EndoCAb values, generally indicative of greater intestinal permeability to pathogens, a finding that contradicts expectations. It is possible that healthier (larger) children had more mature immune systems that were better able to mount a response to insults, reflected in higher EndoCAb IgG values. Evidence supporting the use of EndoCAb for EED assessment is mixed and, to our knowledge, no normative data for the marker exists in the literature. Prior studies have used EndoCAb alone to AAT measure EED (14, 38) , but of 3 studies known to us that measured EndoCAb and L:M concurrently, 1 reported a strong association between the 2 markers (11), 1 found no association (39) and a third did not report agreement between the 2, but did find divergent associations with child height (15) . Our findings further support the need for more normative and mechanistic research into EndoCAb as a marker of EED. Lower GLP-2 values in children who were taller at baseline and in those of higher SES suggest less need for intestinal repair in line with better intestinal health overall. Lower GLP-2 may also indicate slower whole body growth, which again may be expected in relatively healthier children with better growth before the age of 18 months. The inverse associations we see with prior anthropometric measures suggest a potential bidirectionality between EED and growth that will be important to investigate in planned future analyses of the EED biomarkers in relation to longitudinal growth.",

Nesting the study within a large randomized trial allowed for enrollment of participants from an enumerated source population, which, along with the high participation rate, suggests a low risk of bias and good generalizability to rural Bangladesh and perhaps to other rural South Asian populations. In addition to limitations of L:M as a reference method, other caveats include that biospecimens were collected at a single time point rather than serially, a tradeoff we accepted for a larger sample in accordance with a primary aim of investigating interrelationships and agreement among the biomarkers, and a lack of normative data in children for several of the serum and stool biomarkers. Much remains unknown about the performance of these markers under various conditions, such that the present study represents a contribution to the literature in that they were explored simultaneously in a well-described population. Future analyses are planned to explore the dynamics between growth and the EED and systemic health biomarkers using longitudinal models to incorporate serial anthropometric measures and to account for our finding of an inverse relationship between baseline length and some gut health markers.",
