To evaluate the effi cacy of combined treatment of azithromycin with intravenous immunoglo-bulin (IVIG) or methylprednisolone in children with refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP). Methods: Children with RMPP were randomly allocated to group A [intravenous azithromycin (IA)+ methylprednisolone], group B (IA+IVIG) or group C (IA alone). Following a 7-day treatment, group C patients were randomly separated into two subgroups: group C 1 (IA+methylprednisolone) and group C 2 (IA+IVIG). Temperature, respiratory symptoms and signs were examined. The average febrile period after treatment (F 2), average total febrile period (F 3), infiltration absorption, atelectasis resolution, pleural effusion disappearance were determined. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. Results: Seven days after enrollment, the average F 2 after treatment of group A was the shortest. Compared with the control group C, the combined treatment group A and B showed higher rates of infi ltration absorption, atelectasis resolution and pleural effusion disappearance, while lower levels of serum CRP, D-dimer and LDH. Fourteen days after enrollment, all children with combined therapy clinically improved, and presented better laboratory results. Group C 1 showed shorter F 3 and lower levels of CRP and LDH than those of group C 2. Overall, group A showed the shortest F 3 , also has the lowest CRP and LDH. Conclusions: Azithromycin with IVIG or methylprednisolone was better treatment for children with RMPP than azithromycin alone. IVIG treatment may be benefi cial, especially when the efficacy of corticosteroids is insecure, thus could be considered as an alternative of primary therapeutic approaches.",

        "text": "The host innate and adaptive immune systems work together against injury from the MP infection. However, when the inflammatory response was excessively amplified, the clinical course of pneumonia might have worsened. In RMPP, host immune responses may cause pulmonary injury rather than direct microbial damages. [22] Therefore, to some extent, RMPP is an immune mediated disease and therefore immune suppressive therapy might be a rational approach. Some studies reported that immunosuppressant drugs, such as corticosteroids or IVIG, were used in the selected patients. [6, 23] It has been demonstrated that cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in the MP infection progress. Interleukin (IL) 2, IL8, IL5, IL6, IL18 and other cytokines might be involved in the MP infection, and induce the inflammatory response. [24] The hyper immune reaction of T-cells might cause the destruction to the lung tissue. Immunological reactions produced many infl ammatory mediators, which may induce more severe lung injury. [25] [26] [27] The excessive cell-mediated immunity and cytokine responses play an important role in RMPP. [28] RMPP is not only a kind of infection, but also an immune-mediated disease. Corticosteroids can regulate immunity against inflammation reactions. It has been certifi ed that corticosteroids could improve clinical manifestation and lung injury effectively in children and adults with MP infection, reduce lung histopathologic score and decrease mortality in severe pneumonia by decreasing cytokines and reducing the inflammatory response. [2, 21, 29, 30] Even though there are no treatment guidelines for corticosteroid therapy for RMPP, clinicians have been using the corticosteroid in some children. [2, 4, 21] However, the treatment protocols were variable from oral prednisolone of 1 mg/kg/day to intravenously methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for three days. Based on these reports, we initially gave intravenous methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day with IA for 3 days at the beginning (group A) or after a 3-day IA treatment (group C 1 ). Our study also demonstrated that the dose of methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day for 3 days was valuable for RMPP. Various extra-pulmonary manifestations (such as skin rash, MP-associated Stevens-Johnson syndrome and central nervous system disorders) in MP infection may be the result of host immune responses to MP. [24, 31, 32] Immunoglobulins are considered as an effective immune-modulator for various immune-mediated diseases. IVIG has been used in MP-associated central nervous system diseases, and the results showed a rapid recovery. [6] This improvement from some reported cases may be the result of IVIG-induced provision of anti-idiotypic antibodies, which can block the immune-mediated response. [33] It was reported that IVIG had significant activity against MP and provided an extra protection, especially in using antibiotic therapy patients with suboptimal responses. [34] IVIG has been reported to be effective in the treatment of many autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases. Immunomodulation mechanisms of IVIG are not fully understood. The Fc-dependent and/or F(ab0)2-dependent mutually non-exclusive effects might be involved. [35] The wellrecognized anti-inflammatory effects of IVIG can attribute to the interactions between the IgG Fc domains and FccR, also they can modulate the production of cytokines. [35] In addition, IVIG has a remarkable impact on different immune system effector cells (such as B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.), and regulates a wide range of genes. [35] Although only a few studies reported the IVIG use for severe MP, [5, 7] our trial indicated that combined immune-modulating therapy of IVIG is an effective therapy. It should be mentioned that some severe patients might not be excluded from tuberculosis combined infection even though MP-IgM or MP-DNA results were positive. In these cases, IVIG would be safer than corticosteroids. IVIG is extracted from the blood, which should also be noticed on some occasions.",
