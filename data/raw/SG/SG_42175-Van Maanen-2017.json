Melatonin treatment is known to be effective in treating these sleep problems. Bright light therapy might be an alternative treatment, with potential advantages over melatonin treatment. In this study, we compare the effects of melatonin and bright light treatment with a placebo condition in children with chronic sleep onset insomnia and late melatonin onset. Methods: Eighty-four children (mean age 10.0 years, 61% boys) first entered a baseline week, after which they received melatonin (N = 26), light (N = 30), or placebo pills (N = 28) for 3 to 4 weeks. Sleep was measured daily with sleep diaries and actigraphy. Before and after treatment children completed a questionnaire on chronic sleep reduction, and Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) was measured. Results were analyzed with linear mixed model analyses. Results: Melatonin treatment and light therapy decreased sleep latency (sleep diary) and advanced sleep onset (sleep diary and actigraphy), although for sleep onset the effects of melatonin were stronger. In addition, melatonin treatment advanced DLMO and had positive effects on sleep latency and sleep efficiency (actigraphy data), and sleep time (sleep diary and actigraphy data). However, wake after sleep onset (actigraphy) increased with melatonin treatment. No effects on chronic sleep reduction were found. Conclusions: We found positive effects of both melatonin and light treatment on various sleep outcomes, but more and stronger effects were found for melatonin treatment.",

The results were based on studies in adolescents and adults, as the effects of light therapy on sleep problems in children have not been investigated yet.

Although effects of light therapy on sleep latency (only for sleep diary data) and sleep onset time were also found, the effects on sleep onset were stronger with melatonin treatment. Moreover, melatonin treatment exerted additional effects on parent-reported assumed sleep time and on actigraphy outcomes sleep latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency, for which no light therapy effects were found. On the contrary, wake after sleep onset increased significantly (with approximately 7 minutes) during treatment in the melatonin group, but has not affected total sleep time negatively since it was compensated by the positive effects of melatonin treatment on sleep latency (15-minute reduction). A further finding was that DLMO advanced after melatonin treatment. However, no treatment effects on chronic sleep reduction were found. The positive effects of melatonin treatment with medium to large effect sizes (following the criteria of Cohen 40 ) for sleep diary data and small to medium effect sizes for actigraphy data are in line with earlier research that showed beneficial effects of melatonin use in children. 15, 16, 18 However, it must be noted that despite these relatively large effect sizes, sleep latency in the melatonin group decreased with only approximately 15 minutes and was still longer than 30 minutes, and total sleep time increased with only 5 minutes, contrary to earlier studies that found larger changes in sleep times. 15, 16 However, although sleep duration was only 5 minutes longer after treatment, sleep onset advanced with half an hour.

[14] [15] [16] 41 In our patient group 19:00 h was about 2 hours before DLMO, suggesting that advancement of sleep onset can be attributed to the chronobiological effects of melatonin. This does however not exclude a role for its soporific effects. 42 Possibly the chronobiological effect could have been stronger if melatonin was administered 3-5 hours before DLMO, as recommended by recent guidelines. 13 There might be various explanations for the fact that we did not find substantial effects of light therapy. First, in order to make light therapy feasible for application in children, we did not ask the children to advance the timing of the light therapy throughout the study period, which is recommended to enlarge potential effects. 43, 44 In fact, we noticed that applying light therapy at the dedicated time, in this study during 30 minutes between 6:00 and 8:00 h, was already problematic for some families, as in approximately 12% of the mornings light therapy was applied later than the prescribed time window. In addition, it could be that the daily treatment duration of 30 minutes was too short. Research has shown that increasing the duration of light therapy may be more beneficial than increasing light intensity. 45 In order to examine optimal light treatment for this group of children, future research should investigate the use of other light therapy protocols (eg, with shifts in timing of bright light use, limiting light exposure in the evening by having children wear dark goggles). Moreover, children in the melatonin and placebo groups also experienced outdoor light in the morning when they went to school, which could have strengthened the effect of melatonin. However, as treatment was randomized all groups will have experienced about equal amounts of morning outdoor light exposure, so we do not think that this has influenced our results. Nevertheless, for future research it would be interesting to measure light exposure levels so that this can be taken into account. Surprisingly, although melatonin treatment had positive effects on all other sleep outcomes, wake after sleep onset increased during melatonin treatment. Previous studies either did not report about such effects or did not find any effects on wake after sleep onset. 46, 47 However, these studies did not involve treatment of children with melatonin. Current clinical experience at the Dutch Centre of Sleep-Wake Disorders and Chronobiology suggests that increased wake after sleep may disappear when melatonin dose is lowered (M.G. Smits, personal communication, April 26, 2016) . When the dose is too high, response to melatonin treatment may be lost, due to slow melatonin metabolism, which might be associated with CYP1A2 polymorphisms. 48, 49 Consequently, recent recommendations for melatonin treatment in children 13 are to start melatonin at a lower dose (ie, 1 mg) than the dose we used in the present study. Future studies are needed to investigate the possible relation between the dose of melatonin treatment and wake after sleep onset.",
