In this double-blind, parallel-group trial (NCT01277523), 392 patients aged 12-17 years were randomised to receive once-daily tiotropium 5 \u00b5g or 2.5 \u00b5g, or placebo, as an add-on to ICS plus other controller therapies over 12 weeks. The primary and key secondary end-points were change from baseline (response) in peak forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) within 3 h post-dosing (FEV1(0-3h)) and trough FEV1, respectively, after 12 weeks of treatment. Tiotropium 5 \u00b5g provided numerical improvements in peak FEV1(0-3h) response, compared with placebo (90 mL; p=0.104), and significant improvements were observed with tiotropium 2.5 \u00b5g (111 mL; p=0.046). Numerical improvements in trough FEV1 response and asthma control were observed with both tiotropium doses, compared with placebo. The safety and tolerability of tiotropium were comparable with those of placebo. Once-daily tiotropium Respimat add-on to ICS plus one or more controller therapies in adolescents with severe symptomatic asthma was well tolerated. The primary end-point of efficacy was not met, although positive trends for improvements in lung function and asthma control were observed.",

These data are somewhat unexpected in view of multiple other investigations of tiotropium as add-on to at least ICS therapy in adolescents [16] and adults [9, 13] with asthma, which have demonstrated that the 5 \u00b5g dose provides statistically significant improvements in both peak and trough FEV1. Interestingly, in the present study FEV1 improvements, versus placebo, with the 5 \u00b5g dose were even higher than those observed with the 2.5 \u00b5g dose at weeks 4 and 8, and so the decline in lung function at week 12 for patients receiving the 5 \u00b5g dose is not in line with the results at prior time points.

Firstly, the occurrence of a pronounced placebo response was observed, which left little room for differentiation between the treatment groups and may be an indication of improved initial adherence to background ICS therapy in the clinical trial setting.

Secondly, the relatively short trial duration did not permit a conclusive analysis of the impact of tiotropium add-on therapy on severe exacerbations, asthma worsening or asthma control. Therefore, further clinical trials of longer duration in adolescent patients with confirmed severe symptomatic asthma would be beneficial to confirm and expand these initial results from our trial. In addition, the trial was powered to detect a difference of 150 mL in the primary end-point of peak FEV1(0-3h) response, based on a standard deviation of 420 mL; however, the observed standard deviation was \u223c510 mL, slightly higher than predicted. Therefore, the study may have been underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference, possibly because the lung volumes in adolescents are more variable across age and sex.",
