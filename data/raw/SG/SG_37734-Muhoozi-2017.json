The effect of an education intervention including nutrition, stimulation, sanitation, and hygiene on child growth and cognitive/language/motor development, delivered to impoverished mothers in Uganda, was assessed. In a community-based, open cluster-randomized trial, 511 mother/children dyads aged 6-8 months were enrolled to an intervention (n = 263) or control (n = 248) group. The primary outcome was change in length-forage z-score at age 20-24 months. Secondary outcomes included anthropometry and scores on the 2 developmental scales: Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. There was no evidence of a difference in mean length-forage z-score at 20-24 months between the 2 study groups: 0.10, 95% CI [\u22120.17, 0.36], p = .49. The intervention group had higher mean composite development scores than the controls on Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III, the mean difference being 15.",

We also lack data on birthweight and maternal weight gain during pregnancy, which could have interfered with our findings because they are linked to long-term nutritional manifestations. Due to the rural setting with challenging logistics, we could not collect nutrient biomarkers or measures of body composition. Similarly, we could not apply objective, neuropsychological tests. Moreover, we were unable to examine other factors that could have diluted the effect of the intervention, such as other sources of information (e.g., traditional knowledge and practices) as well as seasonality and its influence on food diversity. The intervention could have been improved with a higher frequency of contact with the mothers groups. The main strengths of the study were the long follow-up time and low rates of loss to follow-up, the inclusion of the WASH in nutrition messaging, the use of two independent developmental tools, and the empowerment and collaboration between mothers to increase focus on child health and development.",
