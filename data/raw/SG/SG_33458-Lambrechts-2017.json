Methods-Children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy, not eligible for epilepsy surgery, were included. Following 1 month at baseline, patients were randomized to either the KD or to care as usual (CAU).Primary outcome is the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency at 4 months. Secondary outcomes are mean percentage of baseline seizures, seizure severity, and side effects. Results-Fifty-seven patients were randomized; nine dropped out, leaving 48 for analysis (i.e., 26 KD, 22 CAU). In an intention-totreat analysis, 13 patients (50%) treated with the KD and four patients (18.2%) of the CAU group were responders.Mean seizure frequency at 4 months compared to baseline, after removal of two outliers in the KD group, was significantly lower (P = 0.024) in the KD group (56%) (95% CI: 36-76) than in the CAU group (99%) (95% CI: 65-133%).Twice as many patients in the KD group had a relevant decrease in seizure severity score (P = 0.070).Patients treated with the KD had a significantly higher score for gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.021) without an increase in the total score of side effects. Conclusions-This trial provides class I evidence that the KD is an effective therapy in children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy compared with CAU. Most often reported side effects are gastrointestinal symptoms.The study has been registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR2498).",

Nine domains of side effects are evaluated: general central nervous system, behavior/irritability, depressive symptoms, cognitive functions, motor problems/coordination, vision, headache, cosmetic and dermatological problems, and gastrointestinal function. The latter includes questions on weight changes, appetite, nausea and stomach trouble, diarrhea, and obstipation. For each of the 43 items, the parents rate the severity of the complaint on a four-point Likert scale (no problem, mild, moderate, or serious problem).",
