Methods: Thirty HD children (18 boys and 12 girls) with constipation who had no surgical complication were enrolled and then randomly divided into two treatment groups. The control group underwent only behavioral therapy comprising high fiber diet, hydration, toilet training and pelvic floor muscles exercises while; the IF group underwent behavioral therapy plus IF electrical stimulation. Patients underwent anorectal manometry before and 6 months after the treatment. In addition, a complete bowel diary with data on the frequency of defecation per week, stool form and the number of fecal soiling episodes, a constipation score and a visual pain score were obtained from all patients before, after treatment and 6 months later. Results: Constipation symptoms were improved in 10 (66%) and 4 (26.6%) patients in IF and control groups, respectively at 6 months of follow up (P b 0.03). Frequency of defecation per week significantly increased after the treatment in the IF group compared with control group at the 6 months of follow up (5.4 \u00b1 2.1 vs. 3.3 \u00b1 1.8 per week, respectively; P b 0.009). In addition, mean pain score was significantly decreased in IF group compared with controls after treatment (P b 0.05). Conclusion: IF electrical stimulation is an effective adjunct to behavioral therapy to overcome symptoms of constipation in postoperative HD patients.",
