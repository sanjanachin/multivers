[5, 6] Although substantial literature has demonstrated the efficacy of medication on improving EF in ADHD through short/medium-term therapy, medications have several potential limitations including partial response or nonresponse, [7] possible side effects, [8] uncertainty about the long-term costs and benefits, [9] and poor adherence. [10] Moreover, except sustained attention, evidence showed that medications did not necessarily normalize the neuropsychological outcomes of children with ADHD. [11] For these reasons, pharmacological treatment alone might not be sufficient to remediate the deficits associated with ADHD, and it is thus necessary to develop additional treatment methods that target core neuropsychological deficits. [12, 13] EF training has been investigated as a potential treatment method for ADHD that might have more long-term benefits and fewer side effects than pharmacological treatment. It is hypothesized that EF training might reduce ADHD symptoms and improve functioning by targeting neuropsychological deficits to mediate ADHD pathophysiology. There are two types of EF training: facilitative intervention training (FIT), which fosters the development of EF through the use of computer-based training programs, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] and compensatory EF training, which is based on behavioral therapy. Regarding FIT, although some evidence indicated that training working memory could improve working memory measures, no significant improvements were found for attention and/or mixed EF training in a meta-analysis. [14] The effects on working memory did not transfer to other neuropsychological tests, behavior, or academic function, [14] which suggested the need to develop ecologically effective EF training programs.
