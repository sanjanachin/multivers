        "text": "BACKGROUND: To investigate whether changing the play environment in primary schools to one that includes greater risk and challenge increases physical activity and reduces body mass index (BMI). SUBJECTS/METHODS: A 2-year cluster randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 16 New Zealand schools (years 1-8). Intervention schools (n = 8) redesigned their play environments to encourage imaginative and independent free play by increasing opportunities for risk and challenge (for example, rough-and-tumble play), reducing rules and adding new playground components (for example, loose parts). Control schools (n = 8) were asked to not change their play environment. A qualified playworker rated all school play environments at baseline and 1 year. Primary outcomes were moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (7-day accelerometry) and BMI z-score, collected in 840 children at baseline, 1 and 2 years. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. RESULTS: Multiple changes were made to the school play environments resulting in a significant difference in overall play evaluation score between intervention and control schools of 4.50 (95% confidence interval: 1.82 to 7.18, P = 0.005), which represents a substantial improvement from baseline values of 19.0 (s.d. 3.2). Overall, schools liked the intervention and reported many benefits, including increased physical activity. However, these beliefs did not translate into significant differences in objectively measured physical activity, either as counts per minute (for example, 35 (\u221251 to 120) during lunch break) or as minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (0.4, \u2212 1.1 to 2.0). Similarly, no significant differences were observed for BMI, BMI z-score or waist circumference at 1 or 2 years (all P40.321). CONCLUSIONS: Altering the school play environment to one that promoted greater risk and challenge for children did not increase physical activity, nor subsequently alter body weight. Although schools embraced the concept of adding risk and challenge in the playground, our findings suggest that children may have been involved in different, rather than additional activities.",

These findings are discussed in detail in a separate paper. 27 Figure 1 describes the flow of children throughout the study. A total of 840 were measured at baseline and 630 of these children remained at 2 years. Final analyses were undertaken in children for whom we had baseline and at least one follow-up measure (n = 704 for MVPA and n = 743 for BMI z-score). Only four children (0.5%) withdrew from the study, but a further 180 children were lost to follow-up (21.4% of the 840 baseline participants) from moving out of the area. Similar characteristics were observed between groups at baseline ( Table 2) . At baseline, 2.7% of children were underweight, 73.4% normal weight, 16.0% overweight and 7.9% obese. 28 No significant differences were observed between control and intervention groups in break time or lunch time activity at either 1 or 2 years, or in overall activity (CPM) across the school day (for example, 0900-1500 hours) or whole day (time the child woke up until they went to sleep) at 1 year (Table 3 ).

        "text": "Our findings and those of the Sydney project should not be taken to mean that changing the school playground to include more risk and challenge is not beneficial for children or, indeed, schools in a wider context. Interviews with intervention schools clearly showed they believed the intervention to have been beneficial for their school community. 27 It is feasible that use of accelerometry to assess physical activity may obscure real changes in the type or quality of play that intervention children reportedly engaged in such as building huts, climbing trees and imaginative play. Although these activities are designed to increase risk and challenge, they may not necessarily increase MVPA and accelerometers are not particularly effective at accurately measuring the upper-body movement involved in these behaviours. 42 Alternative measures of activity assessment in children such as the System for Observing Play and Leisure Activity in Youth 43 also classify physical activity into intensities and do not measure type or quality of play itself. Alternatively, the lack of intervention benefit we observed may have been because our population was already sufficiently active (baseline mean MVPA of 67 min), leaving little opportunity for increases in MVPA. Although choice of physical activity cutoff can substantially affect levels of MVPA, 44 CPM-which reflect overall activity and are independent of intensity cutoffs-also did not increase in our study, suggesting that choice of arbitrary intensity cut-point is not relevant. Certainly, the literature is clear that increasing physical activity has proven to be extremely challenging in children, [2] [3] [4] whether referring to family-based 3 interventions or those targeting the school environment 45, 46 or curriculum. 47 Why it is so difficult to substantially increase physical activity in children is not clear, but increasing evidence suggests that Comprehensive School Physical Activity Programs may offer the best solution, 6 with several studies demonstrating their efficacy. 7, 48, 49 Although schools in New Zealand are required to include many aspects of Comprehensive School Physical Activity Programs as part of the curriculum, 50 analysis of our policy questionnaire illustrated that schools could still improve in this area, with overall scores of 76%.",
