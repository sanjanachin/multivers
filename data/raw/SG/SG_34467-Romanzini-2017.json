Objective: To investigate sleep quality in socially vulnerable adolescents, correlating the results with cognitive problems and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and assessing the effectiveness of sleep hygiene and an educational intervention. Design: Cross-sectional and interventional study. Setting: an educational charitable center supported by a Catholic institution, in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. Participants: 125 male and female high school students. Interventions: As first step the subjects were administered specific questionnaires, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), followed by an educational activity that was combined with an unblinded, randomized interventional study. Next, a crosssectional study was conducted to determine the influence of cognition and ADHD on the sleep. Main outcome and measures: Sleep was evaluated using PSQI and ESS. Cognitive assessment was based on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and ADHD by a clinical interview the Multimodal Treatment Study for ADHD (MTA-SNAP-IV). Results: The average duration of sleep per night were 6 h 30 m. 80% of the sample presented sleep complains. Of these, 44% had excessive daytime sleepiness and 69.6% had poor sleep quality related to use of electronic media, environmental violence, and emotional issues. There were no significant associations between sleep problems and cognitive problems or ADHD. Sleep quality improved in 17% of the 53 students with previous sleep complains who participated in any of the two interventions. Conclusions: A high prevalence of sleep deprivation and sleep complains was found in the study sample. The interventions showed some positive effects on the improvement of sleep quality.",

A recent publication suggests 8e10 h of sleep daily for adolescents aged 14e17, and 7e9 h for young adults aged 18e25. 1 Children and adolescents have shown reduced amount of sleep and worse sleep quality in recent years. 2, 3 Key areas of development, such as cognition and behavior, are usually affected by chronic sleep deprivation. 4 Sleep problems are often reported in adolescents. On one hand, their sleep pattern is more vulnerable to the influence of biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. 5 On the other hand, adolescents are less affected by parental influence, whereas external influences, such as extracurricular and social activities, usually become stronger. 3 Even though children and adolescents usually spend a lot of time in their bedrooms or lying in bed, they reduce the amount of sleep hours to engage in other activities of greater interest, such as use of electronic media (television, video games, and the Internet). These habits are related to increased sleep latency and shorter duration of sleep. 6, 7 Sleep quality is also negatively affected by socioeconomic factors such as inappropriate living conditions. 8 People living in areas with high levels of insecurity may have worse sleep quality. 9 A study has demonstrated increased sleep quality after housing upgrading. 10 In addition, adults with a disadvantaged socioeconomic status, particularly related to unemployment and low income, have been found to have insomnia-related symptoms. 11 Poor sleep quality has an impact on the regulation of key daily functions, such as behavior, emotion, cognition, and attention; thus negatively affecting academic performance. 12e14 Previous studies have shown that sleep problems are often among the comorbidities most commonly associated with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 15, 16 According to other studies, 30% of children and 60e80% of adults with ADHD have symptoms of sleep problems, such as daytime sleepiness, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, and sleep-related breathing disorders. 17, 18 Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate sleep quality in socially vulnerable adolescents, correlating the results with cognitive problems and ADHD, and assessing the effectiveness of sleep hygiene and an educational intervention. The approach used in the present study may provide greater understanding of sleep problems among children and adolescents that lives in unfavorable environments and also may show the effects of social inequity in sleep quality.",
