Administration of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains were often experienced in many studies and the use of these two microorganisms was recommended in guidelines 2, 16 . The use of a single or combined probiotics in premature infants was shown to result in a significant reduction in the incidence of NEC and mortality 17, 18 . In their meta-analysis, Olsen et al. 19 found a 45% decrease in the incidence of NEC with probiotic use (RR: 0.55; 95%CI 0.39-0.78; p<0.005). In another study 1,315 preterm infants were randomized and administered 8.2-9.2 log 10 of Bifidobacterium breve, but no significant decrease was found on NEC, lateonset sepsis (LOS) and death (RR:0.93,RR:0.97, RR:0.93) respectively 20 . This has shown that each strain has different effectiveness on NEC. Repa et al. 21 studied preterm infants; they gave 10 9 cfu Lactobasillus acidophilus and 10 9 cfu Bifidobacterium bifidum, although not statistically significant, they showed a reduction in NEC at preterm infants and this was more effective in the breastfed group. The type of the probiotic strains and their combined use, as well as the appropriate amount are important for their effectiveness. In studies performed, generally, 1.5x10 9 cfu as the initial dose and 3x10 9 cfu as the maintenance dose have been preferred 2, 22, 23 . In our study, the preferred high dose (4x10 9 cfu) is a distinguishing feature from the other studies. Again in the literature, it is stated that the most effective time to reduce the incidence of NEC is until 4-6 weeks, and the most effective time to reduce sepsis and mortality is until discharge or longer than 6 weeks 18 . We also investigated the effects of long-term use of probiotics, by targeting 4-6 weeks in this study. In the group without the probiotic support, NEC rate was 10%, and no NEC was observed in the probiotic group; this observation may be interpreted as a positive effect of probiotic use at the appropriate dose, time and content, as well as breastfeeding. In the group without probiotic use, the increase in rates of mortality (OR: 71.5; 95% CI:3.9-1294.7) draws attention to the importance of using the proper probiotics in appropriate dose and time in this sensitive premature group.",
