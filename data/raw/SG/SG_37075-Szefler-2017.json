Objective: We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily tiotropium Respimat add-on therapy to high-dose ICS with 1 or more controller medications, or medium-dose ICS with 2 or more controller medications, in the first phase III trial of tiotropium in children with severe symptomatic asthma. Methods: In this 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, 401 participants aged 6 to 11 years were randomized to receive once-daily tiotropium 5 mg (2 puffs of 2.5 mg) or 2.5 mg (2 puffs of 1.25 mg), or placebo (2 puffs), administered through the Respimat device as add-on to background therapy. Results: Compared with placebo, tiotropium 5 mg, but not 2.5 mg, add-on therapy improved the primary end point, peak FEV 1 within 3 hours after dosing (5 mg, 139 mL [95% CI, 75-203; P < .001]; 2.5 mg, 35 mL [95% CI, 228 to 99; P 5 .27]), and the key secondary end point, trough FEV 1 (5 mg, 87 mL [95% CI, 19-154; P 5 .01]; 2.5 mg, 18 mL [95% CI, 248 to 85; P 5 .59]).

Based on this comprehensive clinical evidence, tiotropium is approved in several countries for the treatment of symptomatic asthma in adults [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and in the United States for the treatment of children aged > _12 years. [10] [11] [12] Furthermore, the current Global Initiative for Asthma recommendations include tiotropium add-on therapy as part of steps 4 and 5 of the stepwise approach for patients aged > _12 years. 13 In children aged 6 to 11 years, the current Global Initiative for Asthma strategy recommends treatment with low-dose ICSs, followed by a stepwise increase in ICS dose and/or additional (or second class of) maintenance therapy, such as a long-acting b 2agonist (LABA) or leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), if control has not been achieved. 13 However, treatment according to guidelines has been reported to result in sufficient asthma control in only around 50% of pediatric patients. 3, 14, 15 This may be explained in most cases by low adherence to asthma treatment, which is of general concern in asthma patients and is notably poor in the pediatric population. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Prescribing physicians may also not adhere consistently to treatment guidelines and may fail to prescribe appropriate therapy or provide adequate education for pediatric asthma patients, compounding the issue of poor asthma control. 22, 23 However, a proportion of patients have asthma that remains unstable or suffer from frequent exacerbations despite adhering to therapy and after addressing any comorbidities. [24] [25] [26] Asthma exacerbations are linked with high morbidity, risk of mortality, and high treatment costs. 27 The risk of an asthma exacerbation increases with decreasing lung function, and recurring exacerbations may lead to the development of persistent asthma in children [28] [29] [30] and significantly poorer lung function, 28 leading to a potentially higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adulthood. 31, 32 Pediatric patients with asthma also have higher rates of comorbidities, including depression and behavioral disorders, which rise further with increasing asthma severity. 33 Children with poorly controlled asthma are at a higher risk of suffering from sleep interference and night-time awakenings and may miss school days as a result. 3, [34] [35] [36] Overall, therefore, there is a need to improve adherence through better communication strategies 37 and for additional options for the treatment of suboptimally controlled asthma. 16 Safety considerations are particularly relevant in younger patients, and it is important that potential new therapies are both efficacious and well tolerated.",

Statistically significant improvements in the primary end point, peak FEV 1(0-3h) response, were observed with tiotropium 5 mg only so all subsequent analyses, including those for the key secondary end point of trough FEV 1 response, were considered descriptive. Likewise, improvements in the key secondary end point, trough FEV 1 response, were statistically significant with tiotropium 5 mg only. Peak FVC (0-3h) and trough FVC responses with tiotropium were not statistically significant. The safety and tolerability of tiotropium were comparable with those of placebo, consistent with previously published data in adults and adolescents. 9, 11, 12 The significant improvements in peak and trough FEV 1 responses observed with tiotropium in this study of children with severe symptomatic asthma are consistent with published data in adults and adolescents with comparable asthma severity, suggesting that consistent findings are generally observed across the tiotropium trial program in both adult and pediatric asthma patients.

These responder rates are similar to those observed in adolescent patients 11, 12 and greater than those observed in adults. 5 These data are in line with findings that studies of a second or third controller added on to ICSs are unlikely to achieve the minimum important difference (0.5) in ACQ score versus placebo; this may be attributable to improved adherence with background medication in the trial setting, resulting in improvements from baseline in all treatment arms. 41 Interestingly, despite improvements being observed in asthma control in all treatment arms, a reduction in respiratory adverse events (asthma and decreased PEF rate) was observed with tiotropium compared with placebo, which may be indicative of improved asthma control, as respiratory adverse events can be considered both a safety and an efficacy parameter.",

This is in contrast to the significant improvements versus placebo seen in home-based measurements of evening PEF in adolescents with tiotropium 5 mg 12 and in adults with tiotropium 5 mg and 2.5 mg. 5 Comparison with these other phase III data suggest that the young participants in the current trial may have experienced difficulty obtaining accurate PEF measurements at home in the absence of supervision by a medical professional. 46 Data on the efficacy and safety of ICSs plus tiotropium compared with the combination of ICSs plus LABA are becoming available. 5, 47, 48 The MezzoTinA-asthma study in adults with moderate symptomatic asthma demonstrated that tiotropium shows efficacy and tolerability comparable with those of the LABA salmeterol 5 ; however, data on the efficacy of ICSs plus LABA versus ICSs plus anticholinergic drugs in children are lacking. Surveillance studies have provided further reassuring information in relation to the safety and tolerability of ICSs plus LABA in pediatric patients. [49] [50] [51] [52] Poor medication adherence is a common issue in children, leading to suboptimal asthma control. 53, 54 Once-daily dosing with other asthma medications has been shown to improve adherence versus twice-daily dosing. 55 Once-daily dosing of tiotropium may therefore be of benefit in the stepwise addition of treatments for uncontrolled asthma in children aged 6 to 11 years with severe symptomatic asthma, 13 particularly when a LABA is unsuitable or ineffective. 56, 57 The Respimat Soft Mist inhaler may provide further benefits for pediatric patients with asthma, because it is easy to use and delivers a dose independent of a patient's variable inspiratory flow, which facilitates superior lung deposition compared with alternative inhaler devices. 58 However, effective and repeated instruction on inhaler technique remains of considerable importance, particularly in pediatric patients. 59, 60 The results of this trial should be interpreted in the light of certain limitations. Improved adherence to background medication in the clinical trial environment can lead to a marked placebo response. 41 Additionally, the short duration of the study limits the analysis of severe or seasonal exacerbations, asthma worsening, and asthma control end points, and may have affected the lung function end points. Lung function is the most sensitive assessment for bronchodilator medications and was therefore selected as the primary end point of this study. However, as a result, this trial was not fully powered for the analysis of FEV 1 /FVC, which may provide a more accurate reflection of asthma severity in children than FEV 1 . 44 Similarly, this trial was not powered for the analysis of important patient-reported outcomes such as ACQ score or exacerbations, which require larger, long-term studies to assess. Furthermore, although smaller, short-term studies can provide valuable information over a short time frame, they may overestimate the magnitude of treatment effects and can require validation from larger confirmatory studies. 61 Nevertheless, the relatively large participant population in this trial increases the reliability of the study findings. These data add to the body of evidence from trials in adults and adolescents that demonstrates the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tiotropium Respimat in asthma and provides insight into its real-world efficacy, as tiotropium was studied as an add-on to participants' usual background therapy.",
