[6] [7] [8] The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is among the most commonly used measures of asthma control in both research and clinical settings, and is currently validated for use in patients aged 12 years and older. 7, 9, 10 A related measure, the Childhood-Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) has been validated for in-person administration with report by both children ages 4 to 12 years and their parents. 8 While the C-ACT relies on both parent and child report of asthma control, in some circumstances it may only be possible to obtain parent report. For example, as monitoring of asthma among families at home is increasingly completed online or with mobile apps, children may not always be available when parents complete assessments and young children may lack cell phones needed to provide their own report. Also, simplifying workflows, in this case by including only a parent informant, may substantially increase the rates of survey completion. 11 In a recent study, Nkoy et al 12 adapted the ACT to allow for weekly, rather than monthly, reporting of asthma symptoms and validated this modified measure using either child report or parent report alone. However, prior studies have not compared the results of parent proxy report of asthma control for young children to report by both the parent and the child. We conducted this study to compare the results of a parent proxyreported ACT (PP-ACT) to those of the C-ACT and to explore differences between the two measures to inform the collection of data on asthma control in situations where report from both parent and child is not feasible.",

Prior research has been mixed regarding the accuracy of parent proxy report of asthma control. While some studies have suggested that parents underreport their child's symptoms, 14 others have found that parent report was correlated with subjective measures of asthma control. 15, 16 Similarly, results are mixed regarding the reliability of young children's report of their own asthma control. Prior studies suggest child development affects accuracy of symptom reporting, 17 and that young children may struggle to identify the severity of asthma symptoms or to accurately discern when the symptoms occurred. 18, 19 Additionally, children might underreport symptoms in order to appear \"normal.\" 19 However, Yoos et al 20 found that children were as accurate as their parents in reporting symptoms and concluded that including child report is important in the clinical setting. In this context, our findings that parent and child reporting had moderate agreement suggests that using parent proxy report may be an acceptable alternative in situations where also obtaining child report is not feasible or acts as a barrier to clinicians receiving any report-for example, if a parent is reporting asthma control for a young child on a regular basis through a patient portal or mobile application. However, parent Table 2 . Parent and Child Demographic and Asthma Characteristics by Group and Overall, Where Group A Is Those Who Completed the Childhood-Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) and Then the Parent Proxy ACT (PP-ACT), and Group B Is Those Who Completed the PP-ACT and Then the C-ACT. proxy reporting is likely to be less accurate than the report of both the parent and child together, suggesting that parents should be encouraged to obtain input from their children on asthma symptoms when possible to when sharing information with the health system through a patient portal or mobile app. The ability to obtain parental report may be may be particularly relevant in the population studied, which included primarily black/African American families with public insurance receiving care at urban clinics. Low-income and minority children have the highest morbidity and mortality due to asthma. 21, 22 For example, one study found non-Hispanic black children had an emergency department visit rate 4.1 times higher and a death rate 7.6 times higher than the rates for non-Hispanic white children. 21 As smartphone use is high in urban populations 23 and an increasing number of families use patient portals to connect with the medical home, these tools that provide parents with the ability to report on their child's asthma symptoms between office visits may be an effective method of identifying high risk children. When uncontrolled asthma is identified in this setting, clinicians may assess and reinforce adherence, titrate controller medication for optimal effect, and provide tools or prescriptions to manage environmental triggers such as tobacco smoke 24 in order to decrease morbidity and mortality. Published results suggest that ongoing reporting of symptoms, which can be accomplished through use of a patient portal or mobile app, may improve outcomes. 25 Given that some literature suggests that parents may have difficulties recognizing asthma symptoms or may accept concerning symptoms as normal, 14, 26 providing tools to this population to distinguish well controlled versus uncontrolled asthma may also address salient barriers to effective care. This study has several limitations; most notably there was no independent verification of level of asthma control by a specialist, and pulmonary function tests, as have been used in some studies, were not completed. 7, 8 In addition, all analyses were cross-sectional. However, we compared our results against a validated measure that is commonly used in practice. Additionally, generalizability may be limited as we compared the PP-ACT to the C-ACT in a very specific population. However, as this population has among the highest morbidity and mortality among children with asthma, the use of the PP-ACT may have the highest potential benefit for these children. Furthermore, although we enrolled children with a range of asthma severities, which should increase generalizability, it is possible that our study sample may not reflect the underlying distribution of asthma severity of the general pediatric population. Finally, although parent report of asthma control may be most important for families outside of the office between visits, our study involved the completion of the tool at visits. Prior research using a similar tool has shown the validity of tool use from outside the office. 12 ",
