Methods: A randomized controlled trial (NCT01859533) was conducted on 64 late preterm/term neonates, delivered by cesarean section and presented by respiratory distress shortly after birth. The Neopuff group included 34 neonates received 20 min of early CPAP and control group included 30 neonates received free flow O 2. Plasma BNP was measured baseline and 2 h later. Results: The duration of tachypnea was shorter in Neopuff group with less need of neonatal intensive care unit admission and need of mechanical support (p < .05) with no effect on duration of hospitalization (p > .05). Plasma BNP showed no significant difference between pre-and post-Neopuff levels (p > .05). A positive correlation was found between BNP and duration of tachypnea as well as the length of hospitalization (p < .05) among Neopuff group. Conclusion: Early rescue CPAP reduces the duration and severity of respiratory distress among infants with TTN.",
