This study examined how many needle procedures were successful at the first attempt when children received either a warm lidocaine and tetracaine patch or an eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA) cream. Methods: We conducted this multicentre randomised controlled trial at three tertiary-level children's hospitals in Italy in 2015. Children aged three to 10 years were enrolled in an emergency department, paediatric day hospital and paediatric ward and randomly allocated to receive a warm lidocaine and tetracaine patch or EMLA cream. The primary outcome was the success rate at the first attempt. Results: The analysis included 172 children who received a warm lidocaine and tetracaine patch and 167 who received an EMLA cream. The needle procedure was successful at the first attempt in 158 children (92.4%) who received the warm patch and in 142 children (85.0%) who received the cream (p = 0.03). The pain scores were similar in both groups. Conclusion: This study showed that the first-time needle procedure success was 7.4% higher in children receiving a warm lidocaine and tetracaine patch than EMLA cream.",

The principal aim of both trials was to compare the analgesic effect of the two formulations, and their effect on the procedural success rates was only reported as secondary outcomes. The trial performed on adult patients (10) did not show any difference between the two formulations on the procedural success rate and neither did the only existing paediatric trial (9) . However, the paediatric study was flawed by the fact that the success rate was measured for both anaesthetics after 30 minutes of application, which is different from what is recommended in daily practice, as it is well known that the analgesic effect of the EMLA cream starts after 60 minutes of application (9) . Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the EMLA cream may initially cause vasoconstriction, reducing the success rate of procedures performed within 60 minutes of it being applied (18, 23) . Our study was the first to investigate the effect of a warm lidocaine and tetracaine patch compared to EMLA cream on the success rate of needle procedures in children as the main outcome. We found a first-time success rate with a warm lidocaine and tetracaine patch of 92.4%, which was comparable to previous studies (8, 10) .
