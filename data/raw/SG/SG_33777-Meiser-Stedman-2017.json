Previous trials have intervened within the first month post-trauma and focused on secondary prevention of later post-traumatic stress; however, considerable natural recovery may still occur up to 6-months post-trauma. No trials have addressed the early treatment of established PTSD (i.e. 2-to 6-months post-trauma). Methods: Twentynine youth (8-17 years) with PTSD (according to age-appropriate DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnostic criteria) after a singleevent trauma in the previous 2-6 months were randomly allocated to Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD; n = 14) or waiting list (WL; n = 15) for 10 weeks. Results: Significantly more participants were free of PTSD after CT-PTSD (71%) than WL (27%) at posttreatment (intent-to-treat, 95% CI for difference .04-.71). CT-PTSD yielded greater improvement on child-report questionnaire measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety; clinician-rated functioning; and parent-reported outcomes. Recovery after CT-PTSD was maintained at 6-and 12-month posttreatment. Beneficial effects of CT-PTSD were mediated through changes in appraisals and safety-seeking behaviours, as predicted by cognitive models of PTSD. CT-PTSD was considered acceptable on the basis of low dropout and high treatment credibility and therapist alliance ratings. Conclusions: This trial provides preliminary support for the efficacy and acceptability of CT-PTSD as an early treatment for PTSD in youth. Moreover, the trial did not support the extension of 'watchful waiting' into the 2-to 6-month post-trauma window, as significant improvements in the WL arm (particularly in terms of functioning and depression) were not observed. Replication in larger samples is needed, but attention to recruitment issues will be required.",

This early treatment window is important for several reasons. First, it is not known whether treatment in the 2to 6-months period would have any advantage over natural recovery. One group has found that most recovery occurs by 2-3 months (Le Brocque, Hendrikz, & Kenardy, 2010) . However, a recent metaanalysis suggest that considerable natural recovery can occur up to 6-months post-trauma (Hiller et al., 2016) . Establishing that any active intervention is superior to 'watchful waiting' (i.e. a period without intervention where an individual is 'either encouraged to return for further assessment or offered a specific appointment time', p18; National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2005) is an essential first step for the future refinement of early treatment approaches. Second, children and adolescents typically face great barriers in accessing care (e.g. being frequently reliant on parents to refer them to services, a lack of awareness among children themselves that traumatic stress is a recognized mental health difficulty), making treatment in the first month rare in routine settings. Third, PTSD cannot be diagnosed within 4 weeks of a trauma as diagnostic systems recognize that some acute traumatic stress is normal and may recede without intervention. Fourth, adult studies show that treatment may be successful in this early window (i.e. after the first month, but within 6-months posttrauma; Ehlers et al., 2003) ; we, therefore, sought to replicate that finding in children and young people.",

It is suggested that a study of a multiple-session intervention for children and adolescents with PTSD in the window described above is an important step in the evolution of the early management of traumatic stress in youth and would support these other efforts. Treatment development would be further accelerated by the examination of mechanisms of action.

CT-PTSD aims to reverse or ameliorate those mechanisms proposed to maintain PTSD (trauma-related misappraisals, characteristics of trauma memories, and maladaptive behavioural and cognitive coping strategies; Ehlers & Clark, 2000) .

The control arm in this trial was a waiting list (WL) as (a) there is an absence of any established evidence-based practice for early treatment with trauma-exposed youth; and (b) there is a critical need to establish that treatment outperforms natural recovery (a question not addressed by previous trials). Pragmatically, WL also reflects 'treatment as usual' for recently exposed youth with PTSD within UK youth mental health services (as treatment would not routinely be offered so soon post-trauma).",

Between 1st April 2011 and 31st August 2013, 132 young people were referred to the study. Of these, 63 were not further assessed after initial telephone screening [sought treatment for another condition (n = 18), trauma too long ago (n = 16), unable to contact (n = 7), other primary diagnosis (n = 5), ongoing threat (n = 4), too old/ young (n = 3), multiple trauma (n = 3), not interested (n = 3), already in treatment (n = 3) and ongoing legal action (n = 1)]. There were no age or sex differences between youth who were assessed and youth who were excluded at this initial screening (p > .55). Of 69 cases assessed for suitability, 29 entered the trial (reasons for nonentry detailed in Figure 1) ; the majority were community referrals (n = 19), the remainder ED attendees who were followed up post-trauma (n = 10). Youth who met inclusion criteria but declined to participate in the trial (n = 12) did not differ significantly from trial participants with respect to age, sex or CPSS score (M = 24.56, SD = 6.98; p > .1). Fourteen participants were allocated to CT-PTSD, 15 to WL. The mean number of therapy sessions in the CT-PTSD arm was 8.3 (SD = 2.2). One CT-PTSD participant did not complete the midtreatment questionnaires (opting to start medication treatment for depression and to halt PTSD treatment); the same CT-PTSD participant and two from the WL arm dropped out before completing the posttreatment assessment (one participant did not give a reason for withdrawal; the other felt that trial participation was no longer necessary).

        "text": "This trial has several limitations. While in line with our prestudy power calculation and adequately powered to reveal significant treatment effects of CT-PTSD, the limited sample size rendered the study susceptible to bias (e.g. the unbalanced ethnicity, a trend towards unbalanced socioeconomic characteristics). It is unclear whether the limited representation of males in the trial sample (only 27%) also reflects this issue, or results from problems engaging with this group. The generalizability of the study findings is limited by the use of well-supervised clinical psychologists who were very familiar with a cognitive understanding of PTSD in youth. Some of the measures used to assess mediation effects did not have good internal consistency in this sample. While the WL arm may reflect a 'watchful waiting' approach, it is unclear how well the WL arm reflects 'natural recovery' (as participants knew they would receive treatment soon). Treatment fidelity was not formally assessed using a sessional coding system. Future evaluations of CT-PTSD, for acute or chronic PTSD, now need to consider its utility relative to an 'active' control condition including therapist contact (e.g. supportive counselling), and consider its role as part of stepped-care and indicated interventions for trauma-exposed youth that may be more cost-effective. Careful attention to recruitment and engagement issues will be required for any future evaluation of CT-PTSD as an early treatment. Despite recruiting from a wide area (the counties of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire in England, comprising several hundred thousand youth in the target age range) and having 29 months to recruit, recruitment rate was slow. While research into potential barriers to seeking or accessing care is needed (e.g. parental understanding, more widespread use of screening tools, referral pathways), these data may alert clinicians and referrers to the possibility of successful early treatment for PTSD that results from commonly occurring traumatic stressors.",
