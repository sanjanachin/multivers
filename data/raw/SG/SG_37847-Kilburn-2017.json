Models that exclusively use nurses as home visitors may cost more and be infeasible given nursing shortages in some locations. The goal of this study was to test whether a universal home visiting model employing a nurse-parent educator team as home visitors reduces health care use in the first year of life. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial of an intensive home visiting program delivered in homes of primary caregivers and their first-born children in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Intention-to-treat and contamination-adjusted intention-to-treat models were estimated, and 244 primary caregivers participated in the survey. RESULTS: In their first year of life, treatment group children were one-third less likely to visit the emergency department (control group mean, M C = 0.42, treatment group mean, M T = 0.28, P = .02) and were also 41% less likely to have visited a primary care provider \u22659 times (M C = 0.49, M T = 0.29, P < .001). We found no differences between the treatment and control groups for hospitalizations or injuries requiring medical attention. The universal program reduced infant health care use for high-risk and lower-risk families. CONCLUSIONS: Children in families randomly assigned to the program had less health care use in their first year, demonstrating that a universal prevention home visiting model delivered by a nurse-parent educator team can reduce infant health care use.",

        "text": "Previous studies have documented that home visiting programs can affect young children's health outcomes in a number of outcome areas, including reducing the use of emergency medical care and other medical contact. Specifically, the federal Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness (HomVEE) project reviews evaluations of home visiting models, which typically have structured protocols and materials that facilitate replication. The HomVEE project assesses whether the models meet the evidence criteria required for Affordable Care Act funding 4 and documents that 4 of the 19 evidence-based home visiting models reduced medical contact within the child's first year of life. Studies have found that these home visiting programs reduced the number of hospitalizations, 5, 6 overnight stays in the hospital, 7 emergency department (ED) visits, 8 and visits to the family doctor. 9 Three of these models employ nurses as home visitors-Early Intervention Program for Adolescent Mothers, Durham Connects (currently known as Family Connects), and Nurse Family Partnership. The predominance of nurses as home visitors is supported by research demonstrating that nurse home visitors are more effective than paraprofessionals at delivering the Nurse Family Partnership model. 10 All models target mothers who demonstrate some risk factor, such as being an adolescent or low-income, except Durham Connects, which is offered to the families living in the county when they have a baby born at the hospital. Durham Connects provides an initial home visit 2 to 12 weeks after the birth of a child plus a follow-up phone call 1 month later. Up to 2 additional nurse visits may be provided if needed. The other 2 models are more intensive, providing between 12 and 40 visits in the child's first year of life. This paper reports findings from a randomized clinical trial evaluation of the First Born Program (FBP), a universal home visiting model for first-time parents and their children. The FBP model combines health care workers and lay parent educators as home visitors. This paper tests the hypothesis that the FBP reduces the need for medical contact during a child's first year of life. The goal of this study was to test whether a universal home visiting model employing a nurse-parent educator team as home visitors reduces health care use in the first year of life. This paper adds to the literature on whether home visitors other than nurses can be effective. Given that nursing shortages are expected to grow over the next decade, 11 understanding the effectiveness of home visiting models that require fewer nurses will provide useful guidance to policymakers.",
