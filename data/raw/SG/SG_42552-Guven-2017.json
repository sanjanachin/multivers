Materials and Methods. In this randomized clinical trial, 29 healthy 5-to 7-year-old children with at least four carious primary molars with no clinical or radiographic evidence of pulp degeneration were enrolled. The pulpotomy agents were assigned as follows: Group 1: BD; Group 2: MTA-P; Group 3: PR-MTA; and Group 4: FS. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed at 6, 12, and 24 months. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests. Results. Total success rates at 24 months were 82.75%, 86.2%, 93.1%, and 75.86%, respectively. No statistically significant differences in total success rates were observed among the groups at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. When the groups were compared according to follow-up times, the success rates in each group did not vary significantly among the 6-12-month, 6-24-month, or 12-24-month periods (> 0.05). Conclusion. Although the success rates of BD, MTA-P, MTA-PR, and FS did not differ significantly, calcium silicate-based materials appeared to be more appropriate than FS in clinical practice.",

Since 2001, MTA has served as a successful bioregenerative treatment alternative in pulpotomy of the primary molars [21] . Clinical trials have moreover shown that MTA has success rates similar or even superior to those of FC and FS [2] . Despite its advantages, including hard tissue formation and dentinogenesis in the pulp, MTA poses drawbacks such as a lengthy setting time, poor handling properties, and high cost [22, 23] .

Although some investigators [51] have considered PCO to constitute a radiographic failure because it demonstrates a deviation from normal pulp, most investigators [46, [52] [53] [54] agree to the contrary, since PCO results from the extensive activity of odontoblast-like cells that suggests retained vitality. In the present study, PCO was not regarded as a failure and was the most commonly observed radiographic finding. After 24 months, PCO was observed in 13.79%, 10.34%, and 3.45% of teeth in the BD, MTA-P, and ProRoot MTA groups, respectively. By contrast, no teeth treated with FS showed PCO. Kusum et al. observed PCO in 16% of teeth treated with BD and 20.0% of teeth treated with ProRoot MTA over a 9-month period [47] . Rajasekharan et al. revealed that their BD group showed more PCO than the ProRoot MTA group, which is consistent with the results of the present study [46] . Investigators who have tested MTA as a pulpotomy material over a 24-month period have reported PCO rates of 5.55% [40] , 7.89% [39] , 20% [11] , 25% [41] , and 26.7% [37] . In this study, PCO was observed in 10.34% of teeth treated with MTA-P and 3.45% of teeth treated with PR-MTA.",

In the current study, internal resorption was considered to signify radiographic failure in all instances and occurred in 6.89% of the FS group and in 3.44% of both MTA-P and BD groups. The low prevalence of internal root resorption in calcium silicate-based materials in the present study corroborates the results of previous research. Watts and Paterson [57] suggested that zinc oxide eugenol can cause pulpal inflammation when directly applied to the pulp tissue, which explains internal resorption when that material is used as a base for pulpotomies. Most authors who observed a high rate of internal resorption in FS or FC pulpotomies have explained their results similarly [11] . However, our results indicate that FS pulpotomy did not exhibit a significant difference from the calcium silicatebased groups. Similar results were reported by Sonmez et al., who demonstrated that internal resorption rates did not significantly differ among their FC, FS, calcium hydroxide, and MTA groups [37] .",

The unavailability of stainless steel crown due to financial constraints dictated treatment using amalgam restorations in all pulpotomized molars. To eliminate inconsistencies resulting from upper restorations, teeth with any extensive loss of structure requiring large restorations were excluded from the study. Additionally, a failed restoration during a follow-up period resulted in the exclusion of the tooth from the sample. Another limitation was the relatively high dropout rate (19.45%) of participants, likely due to the patient's attitude toward dental care. Usually, dental patients seek treatment when they feel pain; when treatment is complete and pain relieved, some patients do not return for follow-up visits.",
